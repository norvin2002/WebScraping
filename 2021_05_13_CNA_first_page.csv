Singapore,Migrant worker who had COVID-19 admits loitering around Changi Airport in bid to take flight home,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/migrant-worker-covid-19-admits-loitering-changi-airport-14807868,1620963234,"SINGAPORE: A 26-year-old migrant worker who suspected he had COVID-19 failed to stay at the hospital as directed, instead taking public transport to Changi Airport where he loitered for hours hoping to get a flight home. Indian national Parthiban Balachandran pleaded guilty on Friday (May 14) to a charge each of exposing others to the risk of COVID-19 infection and leaving an isolation area without permission. Another two charges of exposing others to the risk of infection and of using insulting words towards a health officer will be considered in sentencing. The court heard that Parthiban stayed at Jurong Penjuru dormitory, which was among the dorms declared in April 2020 to be an isolation area. On May 23 last year, Parthiban reported sick at the dorm, complaining of a fever and sore throat. Based on his symptoms and knowing that other dorm residents had reported positive for COVID-19, Parthiban suspected that he was infected with the virus. He was taken to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) by ambulance where a swab test was taken from him. He was transferred to a fever-screening area in the hospital's multi-storey car park, where staff nurses briefed him repeatedly in English and Tamil not to leave until his test results were ready, and not to go anywhere unless instructed. He was also told not to leave so that he would not risk infecting others if he did have COVID-19. Swab test results later showed he was a confirmed COVID-19 case. At about 5.30pm the same day, Parthiban left the hospital without informing anyone, intending to go the airport to buy a ticket and return to India immediately. Closed-circuit television footage showed him leaving with two bags, walking towards Kim Tian Road and crossing an overhead bridge. He walked to Yong Siak Street, where he took a bus and later flagged a cab at Lower Delta Road. He took the taxi to Changi Airport Terminal 1, where he spoke to airport staff and tried to buy a ticket to India. He was not sold a ticket, and loitered at the airport for about four hours until the police found him and escorted him back to SGH. The taxi driver who took him to the airport was issued a quarantine order for 14 days and could not work during this time. He tested negative for the virus. Parthiban completed his period of isolation in the hospital on Jun 8 last year and was diagnosed to be no longer infectious. He was sent back to the dormitory and ordered to serve another 14 days' leave of absence, and was not allowed to leave the dorm. HE LEFT THE DORMITORY FOR THE AIRPORT BEFORE TIME WAS UP AGAIN On Jun 16, before the period was up, Parthiban packed two bags of belongings and left the dorm. He intended to leave Singapore as he knew many dorm residents had tested positive for COVID-19. He took a cab to the airport but was told by airport staff that he could not buy a ticket. He loitered at the airport and slept there, before heading to a relative's home in Tampines the next day. He told his relative that he had left the dorm without permission only after entering the flat. His relative called his employer and the police escorted him back to the dormitory. In a charge taken into consideration, Parthiban also used insulting words at a Ministry of Health officer at Harbourfront Centre on Oct 14 last year. When the officer read a charge to him, he said in Tamil: ""Who are you both to charge me? Are you a judge?"" Other things he said were: ""What rights do you have to charge me?"", ""Have you read law? Or do you have proper education to charge me?"". He also said to the officer: ""I have BABL (Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Law). Do you have a law degree in the first place? Do you want to see my degree?"" The prosecutor is asking for the maximum six months' jail for Parthiban. Defence lawyer Cory Wong of Invictus Law, who took the case on pro bono, asked the judge to remand Parthiban at the Institute of Mental Health for psychiatric observation. DEFENCE ASKS FOR PSYCHIATRIC OBSERVATION He tendered a Jun 8, 2020 memo from SGH indicating that Parthiban was suffering from adjustment disorder close to the time of the offences. He said Parthiban was on medication in April this year and was admitted to IMH last month. He said Parthiban was ""limited by his financial means"", explaining why no psychiatric report was obtained earlier. ""As far as we understand, the prosecution is asking for the maximum six-month jail term. Even with the COVID situation now ... we urge the court to exercise some caution and compassion, so we have all the relevant facts before we proceed with sentencing,"" said Mr Wong. He said the remand would be to assess if Parthiban had any mental condition at the time of the offences and if there was any link between this and the offences. The judge initially had reservations, saying the courts usually order IMH remand only at the charging or initial stages of cases. However, after considering further and after the prosecutor said he did not object, the judge ordered Parthiban to be remanded at IMH for psychiatric observation. Parties will return in June for further hearings. The maximum penalties for exposing others to the risk of infection are six months' jail, a S$10,000 fine, or both."

The nine-month-old boy was being cared for by Mohamed Badruldin Mohamed’s wife, who was the baby's nanny. Police on Tuesday said Mohamed Badruldin sodomised the baby on Apr 27 while his wife was cleaning the living room. A postmortem found bruises on the baby’s mouth, said Petaling Jaya district police chief Mohamad Fakhrudin Abdul Hamid.

Following a report received from a medical officer, police on Apr 29 arrested the couple, who tested positive for drugs. For the first offence, the man was charged with murdering the baby under Section 302 of the Penal Code which carries a mandatory death sentence upon conviction. For the second offence, he was accused of carrying out intercourse against the order of nature on the baby. If found guilty of this offence, he faces between five and 20 years in jail and caning. The man, who was not represented in court, nodded his head for the murder charge and pleaded not guilty to the charge of sodomising the baby. His wife will act as a prosecution witness and charged under Section 15(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, said Mohamad Fakhrudin on Tuesday."

Singapore,Singapore police arrest man and woman over death of newborn baby in Taiwan 2 years ago,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-couple-arrested-newborn-baby-death-taiwan-2019-dna-14788822,1620744775,"SINGAPORE: The Singapore police have arrested a man and a woman over their suspected involvement in the death of a newborn baby in Taiwan two years ago. The man and woman, both 25, were arrested on Apr 28, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) told CNA in response to queries. SPF said it received a request for assistance from Taiwanese authorities after a newborn baby was found dead at a waste management facility in Taipei on Feb 26, 2019. “Since then, the police have been working with the Taiwanese authorities to review the evidence and have commenced investigations,” said SPF. “We are unable to comment further as investigations are ongoing.” BABY'S BODY FOUND IN BLACK PLASTIC BAG Taiwan police told CNA in March 2019 that the Singaporean couple flew into Taiwan on Feb 19, 2019 and left on Feb 26, 2019. The body of the baby girl was found in a black plastic bag by a recycling company employee, who had discovered it while sorting through rubbish collected from across Taipei, local reports said in 2019. Investigations showed that the baby was originally dumped into a kitchen waste basket in central Taipei's Ximending district. CCTV footage showed that a man had thrown the bag into the bin. Tests have determined that the bloodstains found in the Taipei hotel room reportedly booked by the Singaporean couple are a match to the DNA of the baby, Taiwan police told CNA in March 2019. The couple were placed on a wanted list by Taiwanese authorities in February this year, Lianhe Zaobao reported."

Singapore,"Man who evaded payment for massages, facials, ear wax removal gets jail",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-who-evaded-payment-for-massages-facials-ear-wax-removal-gets-14787320,1620725975,"SINGAPORE: A man went for beauty treatments including a shave, blackhead removal and ear wax services worth hundreds of dollars despite knowing that he could not pay for them. Raymond Kang Han Tiong, 40, was given nine months and two weeks' jail on Tuesday (May 11) for four counts of cheating, with another three charges taken into consideration. He will have to serve an additional enhanced sentence of 237 days' jail as he was on remission for previous offences when he reoffended. The court heard that Kang was released from prison on Jul 30, 2020 but was placed on remission for previous offences that include cheating. He began reoffending soon after his release. On the night of Aug 9, 2020, he boarded a taxi with a female friend at 100 Upper Cross Street. He got the driver to drop his friend off before continuing the journey to his home. The total fare was S$31.50. Kang left his NRIC behind with the cabby, promising to return to make payment but failed to do so. The taxi driver later called the police. On Sep 13, 2020, Kang visited Ruby Beauty Centre at The Bencoolen in the Rochor area. Kang ordered services worth S$956 at the shop: A collagen recharge facial treatment for S$278, facial hair shaving for S$138 and blackhead removal for S$540. After the services were rendered, Kang gave various excuses and said he could not pay, requesting to pay another time. He never paid the victim. On Oct 4, 2020, Kang visited a shop called Yan Mei Shan along Jalan Sultan and ordered a 60-minute foot massage and a 90-minute body massage with essential oils for S$140. When it was time to make payment, Kang again said he did not have money to do so. A friend of his paid the shop on his behalf the next day. That same night on Oct 4, 2020, Kang went to a hair salon in Geylang Road and asked for a S$7 hair cut, a S$15 ear-waxing service and a S$48 hair treatment. After he received the services, he said he did not have the money and could not pay for them. He was eventually arrested and later remanded.  RECALCITRANT OFFENDER: PROSECUTOR Deputy Public Prosecutor Sean Koh asked for at least 10 months' jail and an enhanced sentence of 237 days. He said Kang is a recalcitrant offender with convictions dating back to 1998. He had committed similar cheating offences in 2018 by going to various karaoke lounges and ordering packages he could not afford. His lawyer asked for a lower sentence, saying that it should still not be ""too far off"" from similar cases of this nature, but the judge agreed with the prosecution's position, saying that Kang has ""a lot"" of past convictions. For each count of cheating, he could have been jailed for up to three years, fined, or both. Because he committed the offences while on remission, he was liable for enhanced sentences."

Singapore,"Former BP director jailed, ordered to pay more than S$6 million for taking bribes",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/bp-corruption-clarence-chang-koh-seng-lee-pacific-prime-trading-14785880,1620710226,"SINGAPORE: A former director of BP Singapore was jailed for 54 months and ordered to pay a penalty of about S$6.22 million on Tuesday (May 11) for taking bribes. Clarence Chang Peng Hong had suggested that Koh Seng Lee set up Pacific Prime Trading, a petroleum and petroleum products wholesaler, to be a trading counterpart of BP. This was ""on the understanding that Chang would advance the business interest of (Pacific Prime Trading) with BP and would therefore be entitled to payments in return"", said the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) in a press release. Between July 2006 and July 2010, Koh, the executive director of Pacific Prime Trading, gave US$3.95 million (S$5.2 million) to Chang pursuant to their agreement. Koh also agreed to give Chang S$500,000 as a form of investment into an education business franchise that Chang's wife was involved in. Chang and Koh were convicted of corruption in July last year. On Monday, Koh was also sentenced to 54 months' imprisonment. Chang, who was BP's former eastern regional director for marine fuels, separately faces money laundering charges. He allegedly transferred almost S$4.7 million worth of corrupt proceeds from an HSBC bank account in Hong Kong to a POSB account and two other HSBC accounts in Singapore. Chang is suspected of converting nearly S$4 million to buy three private landed properties and two condominium apartments. That amount was wholly or partially the direct or indirect benefits of corrupt proceeds, said CPIB. He was also charged with converting S$111,000 worth of corrupt proceeds to acquire share capital in a pre-school. The money laundering charges were stood down for the purpose of the corruption trial and will be dealt with subsequently, said CPIB. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence in Singapore can be jailed for up to five years, fined up to S$100,000 or both. Anyone guilty of accepting gratification can also be ordered to pay a penalty equal to the amount of that gratification. Those convicted of a money laundering offence can be jailed for up to seven years, fined up to S$500,000 or both. ""To avoid falling victim to dishonest practices by rogue employees seeking personal gains, companies are strongly advised to put in place robust procedures in areas such as procurement and internal audit,"" said CPIB. Companies can refer to CPIB's guidance on measures to prevent corruption, and are strongly encouraged to obtain certification on anti-bribery management systems, said the bureau."
Singapore,Man admits repeatedly molesting barber as she cut his hair in dormitory,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/dormitory-worker-admits-repeatedly-molesting-barber-14785902,1620709049,"SINGAPORE: A man repeatedly molested a female barber who was cutting his hair at an in-house shop in a foreign workers' dormitory. Indian national Wilson Selvanson, 32, pleaded guilty on Tuesday (May 11) to two counts of outraging the barber's modesty. Another two similar charges will be considered in sentencing. The court heard that Selvanson worked as a welder and stayed at a dormitory. The address was redacted from court documents to protect the victim's identity. The victim was working at the barber shop on Jan 2, 2021, when Selvanson walked in. He said he wanted a hair cut and was told to wait his turn. At about 8pm, he sat in the barber's chair and the victim asked him how he wished to have his hair cut. He gestured that he wanted his hair cut short. As the woman began cutting his hair, Selvanson began asking her personal questions such as her age and whether she could remove her face mask as he wanted to see her face. As she cut Selvanson's hair, he reached out and rubbed her buttock before sliding his hands into her jeans. The woman told him to stop and he withdrew his hand, but asked her: ""Is there a problem?"" The victim was scared but continued to cut his hair. Selvanson then reached under her apron and unbuttoned her jeans before molesting her. Shocked, the victim immediately knelt down and backed away from Selvanson, pleading with him to stop and said she was scared. Selvanson then paid her S$6 for the haircut and asked for her mobile number, but the woman refused. She reported the matter to her supervisor and to the police. Selvanson was subsequently identified with the aid of closed-circuit television footage and dorm management records and was arrested. The prosecution has called for a year's jail and three strokes of the cane. The judge adjourned the case for sentencing and mitigation to a later date. For outraging the victim's modesty, Selvanson could be jailed for up to two years, fined, caned, or given a combination of these punishments."
