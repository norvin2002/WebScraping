Singapore,COVID-19: Ex-magazine editor fined for attending 13-person birthday party at Terence Cao's condo unit,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-ex-magazine-editor-fined-for-attending-13-person-14831622,1621310860,"SINGAPORE: A former magazine editor who was at a birthday party at Mediacorp actor Terence Cao's home was fined S$3,000 on Tuesday (May 18) for gathering with 12 other people during the pandemic. Lance Lim Chee Keong, 50, pleaded guilty to one charge of gathering with 12 people not from his household at Cao's condominium in Daisy Road in October last year. The judge noted that Lim was a guest at the residence but went beyond by inviting more people to a gathering that was not necessary. She added that the vast majority of people in Singapore have made tremendous efforts and sacrifices to contain the spread of COVID-19, and that it is crucial for individuals to comply with measures so that the country can overcome the pandemic. At the time of the offence, Singapore was in Phase 2 of its reopening, with a limit of five visitors allowed for households. The court heard that Cao, 53, organised a social gathering at his home on Oct 2, 2020 to celebrate his birthday, as well as the birthdays of Shane Pow, 30, and 32-year-old Xu Mingjie, or Jeffrey Xu.  Several of his local celebrity guests had turned up unannounced at Cao's home to surprise him, but Lim had knowingly invited more people even though the number of guests had exceeded the legal limit. Initially, Cao invited Lim to his place along with artistes Pow, Xu, Benjamin Heng Tee Kok, 45, and Jeremy Chan Ming Yuew, 29. Cao, Lim and Pow had dinner at the condo unit between 7pm and 8pm on Oct 2, 2020. Lim invited artistes Sonia Chew, 30, and Julie Tan Shaoyin, 29, and marketing managers Debbie Lu Shuyi, 34, and Eleanor Wang Chunwei over, expecting them to arrive later. He asked Wang, 34, to bring a birthday cake to the gathering, and also knew that Wang had in turn invited artiste Dawn Yeoh Yishan, 34. THE GUESTS ARRIVE At about 8pm, part-time model and actress Valnice Yek Jia Hui arrived at the condo and Cao allowed the 22-year-old in. Pow had earlier invited her there without knowing that more guests were expected. Before 9pm, 30-year-old sales manager Tan Jun Chuan arrived at the home and Cao let him in. He had gone there to surprise Cao, and did not know that more guests would arrive later. Between 9pm and 10pm, Wang and Yeoh arrived at Cao's home. They did not know that there were going to be more than five guests there, and were unaware that more guests would arrive later. There were now six guests in the unit. Between 10pm and 11pm, Lu arrived at Cao's home to surprise him. Julie and Heng joined the group shortly. The trio did not know there were more than five guests there or that more would be arriving later. There were now nine guests at Cao's home. Between 11pm on Oct 2, 2020 and 12am on Oct 3, 2020, Chew, Xu and Chan turned up at the house and were let in. They did not know there were going to be more than five guests there, and their arrival meant there were 12 guests in total. At about 11.30pm, all 13 participants of the gathering held a birthday cake-cutting ceremony and took group photos of everyone present. Xu posted one of the photos on his Instagram Stories page. Several of the guests left by 1am, leaving six behind. Lu left the condo as well between 1am and 2am on Oct 3, 2020. The remaining guests - Lim, Pow, Xu, Chew and Julie - left between 2am and 4am. Throughout the gathering, the guests chatted, ate and drank without wearing masks. They knew it was against the law to gather in a group of more than five people. HE WAS NONCHALANT: PROSECUTOR Deputy Public Prosecutor Norman Yew asked for a fine of at least S$3,000 to reflect the seriousness of his actions and ""to deter likeminded offenders who place their personal interests over the public's health"". ""Lance Lim was nonchalant towards the laws enacted to protect Singapore against the global COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Mr Yew. ""His conduct belittles the efforts and sacrifices of the vast majority, who have, amongst many things, given up the pleasures of social interaction with family and friends for the public good to contain the spread of COVID-19."" He said the courts should ""firmly denounce such behaviour and send a strong message that we need to continue to be vigilant and comply with measures to prevent another tidal wave of community infections"". Defence lawyers Josephus Tan and Cory Wong of Invictus Law asked instead for a fine of not more than S$2,500, saying that this was his first offence and an isolated one that was ""wholly out-of-character"" with ""no deep-seated criminality"". They said Lim was ""hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic as he had lost his full-time job as a magazine editor back then"". He could not find any comparable employment for about a year and had to use his own savings to tide over. He has since secured work as a part-time editor to make ends meet after months of unemployment, they said. ""In a way, COVID-19 had indeed did Lance in twice over, the first being employment-wise and the second being offence-wise. He has learnt his lesson and he reiterates his genuine remorse,"" said the lawyers. Lim and Cao were charged in court in March, while the other 11 guests were each given fines of S$300. The Building and Construction Authority had explained that they took into account the 11 guests' level of culpability in issuing them fines. An advisory was also issued to the management of Cao's condominium to remind them to ensure compliance with safe management measures. Cao is expected back in court on May 25 to plead guilty. He is defended by lawyer S S Dhillon, who is also representing Pow for an unrelated drink driving charge."
Singapore,"Daewoo director, project manager in MRT construction project jailed for bribing former LTA director",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/daewoo-lta-corruption-director-project-manager-mrt-jail-14831328,1621306194,"SINGAPORE: Two Daewoo Engineering and Construction executives, who gave bribes to a Land Transport Authority (LTA) deputy group director while working on their company's first project in Singapore, were jailed for eight months on Tuesday (May 18). Kim Young-Gyu, a 52-year-old director, and Ro Sungyoung, a 49-year-old project manager, pleaded guilty to a charge each of conspiring to bribe Henry Foo Yung Thye with S$30,000. Each man had a second charge involving another S$20,000 taken into consideration for sentencing. Kim and Ro are the first to be sentenced in a wide-ranging corruption case where Foo, who was the deputy group director of the Thomson-East Coast and Cross-Island Lines, is accused of taking about S$1.24 million in bribes. The judge noted that both men did not actively seek to cultivate Foo, but said that it was ""not completely for selfless reasons"" when they eventually gave in. Instead, they gave the bribes to benefit themselves and Daewoo, she said. LTA awarded the main contract for the construction of the Stevens MRT station to Daewoo for S$441 million in April 2014. This was the first time Daewoo was awarded a project in Singapore. Kim and Ro worked on the project and reported to Foo for official quarterly meetings with LTA. Foo, who also chaired the tender evaluation committee for the project and had powers to commit LTA to additional expenditures, began asking Ro for loans in mid-2018. Ro was afraid to offend the high-ranking LTA officer and discussed the matter with Kim, his boss. Kim rejected the notion angrily at first, as he knew it was against both Daewoo's policies and Singapore law.  However, Foo kept pursuing Ro for loans, until Kim and Ro decided they could no longer reject him. They hoped that agreeing to his loan request would put them on friendly terms with Foo and facilitate the smooth progress of train station works. Kim also feared that Foo might apply ""time pressure"" on Daewoo if they offended him and influence LTA's inspections of their work. The pair also hoped the loan would stand them in good stead to be awarded future LTA projects, especially in comparison with other contractors who had not given money to Foo. Ro lent Foo S$30,000 after Foo sent him a text message on Dec 31, 2018, saying he needed to raise a sum of money urgently for family issues. After lending Foo the money, Ro began asking Foo for help in return. He turned to Foo in May 2019 after an LTA officer inspected the train station worksite and given Daewoo a negative score for infringements of safety or cleanliness. Foo said he would help by speaking to LTA's group director of safety and contracts. But his intervention did not change the score, and Daewoo did not clinch a project on the Jurong Region Line they had put in a bid for. In August 2019, Foo sent Ro a confidential screenshot of an assessment by the LTA tender evaluation committee, after Ro asked him why Daewoo had failed in the first stage of an LTA tendering process for the construction of tunnels at Changi Airport. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau caught wind of the corruption and the trio were nabbed. Prosecutors had called for eight months' jail for Kim and Ro, while defence lawyers asked for a high fine, or three to four weeks' jail and no more than six months' jail in the alternative. Foo is set for a pre-trial conference in June. He faces 36 charges that range from taking bribes from contractors or subcontractors to cheating his colleagues into giving him loans between 2008 and 2019. The cases for several other co-accused are pending."

Singapore,"Jail for cleaner who assaulted gardeners at Sentosa condo, returned with hammer after being fired",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/jail-cleaner-assaulted-gardeners-sentosa-condo-14827000,1621244996,"SINGAPORE: After a cleaner was fired for assaulting a gardener and his supervisor at a condominium on Sentosa, he returned with a hammer, saying he wanted to smash the gardener's face. Nagarajan Abraham, 49, was given 12 weeks' jail on Monday (May 17) after pleading guilty to two charges of voluntarily causing hurt and two charges under the Protection from Harassment Act. Another three charges were considered in sentencing. The court heard that Nagarajan was a cleaner at the Cape Royale condominium in Sentosa Cove. At around 8.10am on Jan 30 this year he approached a 28-year-old Bangladeshi landscaping supervisor at the landscaping and cleaning storeroom of the condominium. He shouted the victim's nationality, before saying: “I am Singaporean. I go jail, I can bring you go jail.” He punched the victim on his neck before Nagarajan's cleaning supervisor told Nagarajan to leave the room. About half an hour later, a 40-year-old Bangladeshi gardener went to the storeroom to retrieve equipment for his work. He saw Nagarajan arguing with the cleaning supervisor at the exit, and told Nagarajan to move out of the way, as he was blocking the way. Nagarajan turned around and kicked the gardener's chest, before punching him thrice on his forehead and once on the side of his head. After separating Nagarajan and the gardener, the cleaning supervisor locked Nagarajan inside the storeroom. He was fired on Feb 1 for poor work performance and for assaulting the two men. He went back to the condominium on Feb 13 to look for his former supervisor after drinking six bottles of beer. However, the 72-year-old security guard at the guard house recognised Nagarajan and did not let him in. Nagarajan grew agitated and began shouting and gesticulating wildly, before retrieving a small hammer from his bag and saying he wanted to smash the victim's face. He began shouting and scolding the Bangladeshi national for ""causing him to lose his job"", the court was told. His former supervisor heard the commotion and went to the guard house to speak to him. She noticed that he smelled of alcohol and he told her: ""You wait, wait, I got hammer."" He reached into his bag and shouted vulgarities in Hokkien, which alarmed the supervisor. CURSED AT BUS DRIVER AFTER TAKING WRONG BUS In an earlier incident on Sep 5, 2020, Nagarajan boarded a bus in Geylang. A few minutes later, he realised that he had taken the bus in the wrong direction and approached the bus driver to ask where he was going. When told that the bus was headed towards Ghim Moh bus interchange, Nagarajan grew agitated. He began cursing at the bus driver, a 51-year-old Malaysian man. He was subsequently charged in court and remanded. The prosecutor asked for at least 12 weeks' jail and a fine for Nagarajan, saying that he had previous convictions of causing hurt in 2017 and 2018. ""The accused has demonstrated that he is a recalcitrant offender who becomes violent for no apparent reason,"" he said. Nagarajan, who was unrepresented, said he did not scold the victim's mothers, and that he had hurled vulgarities in Hokkien and Malay. The judge asked him if he knew what the words meant, but Nagarajan said he used such words in the army and with his friends, and did not intend to scold the victims' mothers. However, he acknowledged that he had uttered those vulgarities. He said he was very sorry and remorseful and wanted to be released so he can continue paying for his flat. He said he was drunk on the second occasion as he had lost his job. District Judge Marvin Bay told him that he had to control himself when he drank alcohol, as he knew his own tendency ""to succumb to violence and offensive language"" when intoxicated."
Singapore,"Teenager jailed for filming other male students showering, engaging in sex acts",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/teenager-jailed-filming-court-male-students-showering-14826190,1621229118,"SINGAPORE: While studying for his A-Level examinations, a teenager filmed multiple clips of his male schoolmates showering, in the toilet or engaging in sex acts. Tang Jiasheng, 19, was given three months and two weeks' jail on Monday (May 17), along with a fine of S$1,500. He pleaded guilty to eight charges of voyeurism and offences under the Films Act, with another 35 charges considered in sentencing. The court heard that Tang, a China national, was in Singapore on a student pass at the time of the offences. Then 18, he was studying at a private school and living in the school's hostel. Between October 2019 and March 2021, he filmed multiple male students at the hostel during their private moments. One of the victims was in a toilet at the hostel on Jan 19, 2020, when Tang entered the stall next to him. Upon realising there was someone there, Tang placed his phone in recording mode and began filming the victim through the gap at the bottom of the stalls. The victim realised that someone was filming him while he was showering and reported the incident to hostel management. The police came and initially suspected Tang's roommate. In the next few days, Tang continued to film other male students at the school, until his roommate was cleared as nothing incriminating was found on him. A member of the hostel management team tracked down Tang on Jan 22, 2020, and called him into her office. She found a hidden folder in Tang's device containing 39 video clips of male students showering, urinating or masturbating. Another two clips were of Tang himself. Tang admitted to the police that he had been recording videos at the school. He also admitted to an Institute of Mental Health doctor that he filmed male victims at a junior college in 2019 until he was caught. He was not reported to the police then. He said he filmed the male students because it ""aroused him as he could be able to see parts of his victims which they would not reveal"". He also told police that he got ""a thrill from doing something which he knew was wrong and illegal"". Even after he was charged in court and released on bail, Tang continued his crimes, secretly filming a student showering in the hostel in March 2021. ACCUSED IS A RECALCITRANT OFFENDER: PROSECUTOR Deputy Public Prosecutor Chong Kee En asked that Tang be fined and jailed for at least three months and two weeks. ""This is a case involving a recalcitrant accused who had repeatedly filmed other male students in their private moments whilst showering, urinating, defecating, and even when masturbating,"" he said, adding that Tang did so to gratify himself sexually. ""The accused did so whilst reprehensibly violating the privacy of these male victims, whom as foreign students deserved a safe space in the hostel, which would have been their home away from home."" He said Tang has no local roots and cannot be a candidate for probation or reformative training. ""Whilst a term of imprisonment might seem harsh for a young offender such as the accused, it is the only viable option,"" said Mr Chong. The defence said Tang has sought medical treatment of his own volition for a mental condition, but the prosecutor said no contributory link was found to the offences. The judge told Tang to continue his treatment once he is released from jail, as he will be dealt with under the relevant laws if he reoffends."
Singapore,Teen pleads guilty to having sex with underage girlfriend in classroom,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/teen-pleads-guilty-underage-sex-classroom-14825916,1621224888,"SINGAPORE: A teenager repeatedly engaged in illegal sex acts with underage girls, including with his 13-year-old girlfriend in their classroom. The 17-year-old pleaded guilty in a court on Monday (May 17) to two charges of sexual penetration of a minor. Another three charges will be taken into consideration for sentencing. He cannot be named due to gag orders protecting the identities of the victims, as well as the Children and Young Persons Act, which forbids the naming of an accused under 18. According to court documents, the accused began having underage sex in November 2017 when he was 14. In January 2018, he had a 15-year-old girlfriend who studied at the same secondary school. After school ended sometime that month, the girl followed him to his home when no one else was present. As they went in, they decided to engage in consensual sex, said the prosecutor. They had unprotected sex in the living room before the accused accompanied his girlfriend home. The victim lodged a police report stating she had consensual sex with the accused a few months later, and ended her relationship with him afterwards. The accused later started dating another girl. In July 2019, when the girl was 13 and he was 15, the boy suggested going into a classroom to have sex. The girl agreed, as she was ""curious"" about sex, the prosecutor said. After buying condoms, the accused unlocked the classroom door with a key he had and went in with his girlfriend. After he locked the door, they went behind the teacher's table where they cuddled and kissed. He initiated penetration three times and each time the girl said she was in pain. She also expressed fear over engaging in a sex act in a classroom and asked him to stop. The accused stopped what he was doing and the pair put their clothes back on. When the girl told the accused she did not like what they were doing, he said it was okay and that they could ""try again next time"". PROSECUTOR NOT OBJECTING TO PROBATION SUITABILITY REPORT Deputy Public Prosecutor Lee Wei Liang said he would not be objecting to the calling of a probation suitability report ""in view of the accused's young age and nature of the offences"". In response to the judge's questions, the accused said he had not been given any warnings in 2017 before he went on to reoffend. He said he is in his final year in an Institute of Technical Education. ""I'm guilty of all these offences ma'am,"" he said through an interpreter. ""Ever since the last offence, I've realised the wrongdoing I've committed and I've stopped doing all this."" He said he is working part-time as a food deliveryman and supporting his mother, who is unable to work due to medical reasons. He is also supporting his younger brother, an ITE student, and the family of three live in a rented flat. His father has died, he said. The judge asked the accused if he was prepared to keep to school rules as he was returning to school or attending home-based learning classes the next day but still had dyed hair. He explained that he coloured his hair during the school break and would dye it back to black for school. ""If it's school rules and you want to be considered for probation, follow the rules,"" said District Judge May Mesenas. She added that he should attend his classes regularly if he wished to be considered for probation. She called for a report assessing his suitability for it and adjourned sentencing to June. For sexual penetration of a minor, with or without her consent in January 2018, he could be jailed up to 10 years, fined or both. He could be jailed up to 20 years and fined or caned for sexual penetration of a minor under 14 in July 2019."
Singapore,Man charged with sending false message to NTU researcher that he had COVID-19,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-charged-sending-false-message-ntu-researcher-covid-19-14825712,1621222726,"SINGAPORE: A man was charged on Monday (May 17) with knowingly transmitting a false message to a researcher from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) that he could not attend a ""session"" as he had COVID-19 and was quarantined in hospital. Paul Chan Kin Nang, 40, was given one charge of transmitting a false message under the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act to NTU researcher Lau Zen Juen. The charge sheet states that Chan sent an email to Ms Lau at 12.47pm on Sep 6, 2020, stating: ""Hi, I am unable to attend the session tomorrow as I am tested positive for Covid19 and is now quarantine in hospital."" Chan allegedly knew this to be false, as he had not tested positive for COVID-19, the document continued. Court documents at the early charging stage did not elaborate on what ""session"" Chan was supposed to attend, or how the allegations came to light. According to online research websites, the researcher he allegedly lied to is studying the cognitive neuroscience of deception. The email address that he allegedly sent the false message to was listed in a Facebook post aimed at NTU Psychology Majors in July 2020, calling for volunteers to participate in a decision-making study using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A spokesperson for NTU told CNA after the hearing that Chan is a member of the public who is a volunteer participant in a social science study conducted at NTU. ""After he informed the researchers that he could not attend a research session as he had allegedly tested positive for COVID-19, the university promptly checked with the authorities to verify whether he is a confirmed COVID-19 case, due to the need for contact tracing,"" he said. ""When his claim was found to be false, a police report was made. He is no longer participating in the study. As the case is before the courts, we have no other comments at this time."" The offence Chan was charged with is relatively new - it was added to the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act in January last year. The last reported case on such an offence was for Kenneth Lai Yong Hui, a taxi driver who was jailed four months in May 2020 for posting a fake message on Facebook about supposed food outlet closures and urging panic buying. If convicted of the offence, Chan can be jailed up to three years, fined up to S$10,000, or both."

Singapore,Migrant worker who had COVID-19 admits loitering around Changi Airport in bid to take flight home,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/migrant-worker-covid-19-admits-loitering-changi-airport-14807868,1620963234,"SINGAPORE: A 26-year-old migrant worker who suspected he had COVID-19 failed to stay at the hospital as directed, and instead took public transport to Changi Airport where he loitered for hours hoping to get a flight home. Indian national Parthiban Balachandran pleaded guilty on Friday (May 14) to a charge each of exposing others to the risk of COVID-19 infection and leaving an isolation area without permission. Another two charges of exposing others to the risk of infection and of using insulting words towards a health officer will be considered in sentencing. The court heard that Parthiban stayed at Jurong Penjuru dormitory, which was among the dorms declared in April 2020 to be an isolation area. On May 23 last year, Parthiban reported sick at the dorm, complaining of a fever and sore throat. Based on his symptoms and knowing that other dorm residents had reported positive for COVID-19, Parthiban suspected that he was infected with the virus. He was taken to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) by ambulance where a swab test was taken from him. He was transferred to a fever-screening area in the hospital's multi-storey car park, where staff nurses briefed him repeatedly in English and Tamil not to leave until his test results were ready, and not to go anywhere unless instructed. He was also told not to leave so that he would not risk infecting others if he did have COVID-19. Swab test results later showed he was a confirmed COVID-19 case. At about 5.30pm the same day, Parthiban left the hospital without informing anyone, intending to go the airport to buy a ticket and return to India immediately. Closed-circuit television footage showed him leaving with two bags, walking towards Kim Tian Road and crossing an overhead bridge. He walked to Yong Siak Street, where he took a bus and later flagged a cab at Lower Delta Road. He took the taxi to Changi Airport Terminal 1, where he spoke to airport staff and tried to buy a ticket to India. He was not sold a ticket, and loitered at the airport for about four hours until the police found him and escorted him back to SGH. The taxi driver who took him to the airport was issued a quarantine order for 14 days and could not work during this time. He tested negative for the virus. Parthiban completed his period of isolation in the hospital on Jun 8 last year and was diagnosed to be no longer infectious. He was sent back to the dormitory and ordered to serve another 14 days' leave of absence, and was not allowed to leave the dorm. HE LEFT THE DORMITORY FOR THE AIRPORT BEFORE TIME WAS UP AGAIN On Jun 16, before the period was up, Parthiban packed two bags of belongings and left the dorm. He intended to leave Singapore as he knew many dorm residents had tested positive for COVID-19. He took a cab to the airport but was told by airport staff that he could not buy a ticket. He loitered at the airport and slept there, before heading to a relative's home in Tampines the next day. He told his relative that he had left the dorm without permission only after entering the flat. His relative called his employer and the police escorted him back to the dormitory. In a charge taken into consideration, Parthiban also used insulting words at a Ministry of Health officer at Harbourfront Centre on Oct 14 last year. When the officer read a charge to him, he said in Tamil: ""Who are you both to charge me? Are you a judge?"" Other things he said were: ""What rights do you have to charge me?"", ""Have you read law? Or do you have proper education to charge me?"". He also said to the officer: ""I have BABL (Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Law). Do you have a law degree in the first place? Do you want to see my degree?"" The prosecutor is asking for the maximum six months' jail for Parthiban. Defence lawyer Cory Wong of Invictus Law, who took the case on pro bono, asked the judge to remand Parthiban at the Institute of Mental Health for psychiatric observation. DEFENCE ASKS FOR PSYCHIATRIC OBSERVATION He tendered a Jun 8, 2020 memo from SGH indicating that Parthiban was suffering from adjustment disorder close to the time of the offences. He said Parthiban was on medication in April this year and was admitted to IMH last month. He said Parthiban was ""limited by his financial means"", explaining why no psychiatric report was obtained earlier. ""As far as we understand, the prosecution is asking for the maximum six-month jail term. Even with the COVID situation now ... we urge the court to exercise some caution and compassion, so we have all the relevant facts before we proceed with sentencing,"" said Mr Wong. He said the remand would be to assess if Parthiban had any mental condition at the time of the offences and if there was any link between this and the offences. The judge initially had reservations, saying the courts usually order IMH remand only at the charging or initial stages of cases. However, after considering further and after the prosecutor said he did not object, the judge ordered Parthiban to be remanded at IMH for psychiatric observation. Parties will return in June for further hearings. The maximum penalties for exposing others to the risk of infection are six months' jail, a S$10,000 fine, or both."
Asia,"Man charged in Malaysia with murder, sodomy of 9-month-old baby",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/malaysia-man-charged-murder-sodomy-9-month-old-infant-14794864,1620814682,"KUALA LUMPUR: A 36-year-old man was charged in Malaysia on Wednesday (May 12) with murdering and sodomising a baby. The nine-month-old boy was being cared for by Mohamed Badruldin Mohamed’s wife, who was the baby's nanny. Police on Tuesday said Mohamed Badruldin sodomised the baby on Apr 27 while his wife was cleaning the living room. A postmortem found bruises on the baby’s mouth, said Petaling Jaya district police chief Mohamad Fakhrudin Abdul Hamid. The man, who was under the influence of drugs, is believed to have cupped the baby's mouth, likely causing the boy to suffocate. “During the incident, the female suspect was cleaning the living room and had left the baby alone with her husband in a locked room for two hours before finding the baby unconscious,"" said the district police chief in a press conference on Tuesday.  “The victim was taken to the hospital for treatment by the husband who admitted to being the caretaker of the baby,” he added. Following a report received from a medical officer, police on Apr 29 arrested the couple, who tested positive for drugs. For the first offence, the man was charged with murdering the baby under Section 302 of the Penal Code which carries a mandatory death sentence upon conviction. For the second offence, he was accused of carrying out intercourse against the order of nature on the baby. If found guilty of this offence, he faces between five and 20 years in jail and caning. The man, who was not represented in court, nodded his head for the murder charge and pleaded not guilty to the charge of sodomising the baby. His wife will act as a prosecution witness and charged under Section 15(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, said Mohamad Fakhrudin on Tuesday."

Chee Mei Wan, a 41-year-old Singapore permanent resident, and 62-year-old Lim Peng Tiong were charged on Wednesday (May 12) with voluntarily causing grievous hurt to Ms Huang Baoying by hitting her with a wooden pole. Court documents did not specify the relationship between Chee, Lim and Ms Huang. Ms Huang’s brother, 29-year-old Huang Bocan, had his charge amended. He is now accused of sharing a common intention with Chee and Lim to cause grievous hurt to his sister by hitting her with the pole. The incident is said to have occurred at about 11pm on May 4 at Block 602 Clementi West Street 1. Police previously said they were alerted to the unnatural death at 6.30am the next day and arrived to find Ms Huang dead.

The court heard that Prasanth has pending charges for fraud, and had been arrested for failing to attend court under a section of the penal code for breach of home leave under the prison's mandatory aftercare scheme. No bail was offered to him. According to an earlier police statement, they were alerted to a case where a 41-year-old man was attacked by his son and suffered multiple injuries. The victim was taken conscious to hospital but his son left the scene before the police arrived. Preliminary investigations suggest that both men had a dispute before the incident. The accused was identified and arrested within four hours of the reported incident. If convicted of voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous means, he could be jailed up to seven years, fined, caned, or given any combination of these penalties."
Singapore,Singapore police arrest man and woman over death of newborn baby in Taiwan 2 years ago,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-couple-arrested-newborn-baby-death-taiwan-2019-dna-14788822,1620744775,"SINGAPORE: The Singapore police have arrested a man and a woman over their suspected involvement in the death of a newborn baby in Taiwan two years ago. The man and woman, both 25, were arrested on Apr 28, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) told CNA in response to queries. SPF said it received a request for assistance from Taiwanese authorities after a newborn baby was found dead at a waste management facility in Taipei on Feb 26, 2019. “Since then, the police have been working with the Taiwanese authorities to review the evidence and have commenced investigations,” said SPF. “We are unable to comment further as investigations are ongoing.” BABY'S BODY FOUND IN BLACK PLASTIC BAG Taiwan police told CNA in March 2019 that the Singaporean couple flew into Taiwan on Feb 19, 2019 and left on Feb 26, 2019. The body of the baby girl was found in a black plastic bag by a recycling company employee, who had discovered it while sorting through rubbish collected from across Taipei, local reports said in 2019. Investigations showed that the baby was originally dumped into a kitchen waste basket in central Taipei's Ximending district. CCTV footage showed that a man had thrown the bag into the bin. Tests have determined that the bloodstains found in the Taipei hotel room reportedly booked by the Singaporean couple are a match to the DNA of the baby, Taiwan police told CNA in March 2019. The couple were placed on a wanted list by Taiwanese authorities in February this year, Lianhe Zaobao reported."

The man, who is of Chinese ethnicity, was arrested “for public nuisance, uttering words with intent to wound the racial feelings of others and voluntarily causing hurt”, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) said on Tuesday (May 11). The woman, who is of Indian ethnicity, was walking along a walkway at Choa Chu Kang Drive at about 8.45am on May 7 when she was confronted by a Chinese couple to wear her mask properly, the SPF said in a news release. “She purportedly got into a verbal exchange with the man. The man allegedly uttered an offensive racial remark and assaulted her, causing her to fall to the ground,” the police said. The couple then left the scene and the woman was assisted by a member of the public. Investigations are ongoing, said the police. The case had prompted comments on Facebook from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and several other ministers on Monday. Minister for Law and Home Affairs K Shanmugam also spoke in Parliament on Tuesday about the incident. If found guilty of public nuisance, the man could be jailed for up to three months, fined up to S$2,000, or both. For uttering words with deliberate intent to wound the racial feelings of any person, the punishment is an imprisonment term of up to three years, a fine, or both.

Singapore,"Man who evaded payment for massages, facials, ear wax removal gets jail",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-who-evaded-payment-for-massages-facials-ear-wax-removal-gets-14787320,1620725975,"SINGAPORE: A man went for beauty treatments including a shave, blackhead removal and ear wax services worth hundreds of dollars despite knowing that he could not pay for them. Raymond Kang Han Tiong, 40, was given nine months and two weeks' jail on Tuesday (May 11) for four counts of cheating, with another three charges taken into consideration. He will have to serve an additional enhanced sentence of 237 days' jail as he was on remission for previous offences when he reoffended. The court heard that Kang was released from prison on Jul 30, 2020 but was placed on remission for previous offences that include cheating. He began reoffending soon after his release. On the night of Aug 9, 2020, he boarded a taxi with a female friend at 100 Upper Cross Street. He got the driver to drop his friend off before continuing the journey to his home. The total fare was S$31.50. Kang left his NRIC behind with the cabby, promising to return to make payment but failed to do so. The taxi driver later called the police. On Sep 13, 2020, Kang visited Ruby Beauty Centre at The Bencoolen in the Rochor area. Kang ordered services worth S$956 at the shop: A collagen recharge facial treatment for S$278, facial hair shaving for S$138 and blackhead removal for S$540. After the services were rendered, Kang gave various excuses and said he could not pay, requesting to pay another time. He never paid the victim. On Oct 4, 2020, Kang visited a shop called Yan Mei Shan along Jalan Sultan and ordered a 60-minute foot massage and a 90-minute body massage with essential oils for S$140. When it was time to make payment, Kang again said he did not have money to do so. A friend of his paid the shop on his behalf the next day. That same night on Oct 4, 2020, Kang went to a hair salon in Geylang Road and asked for a S$7 hair cut, a S$15 ear-waxing service and a S$48 hair treatment. After he received the services, he said he did not have the money and could not pay for them. He was eventually arrested and later remanded.  RECALCITRANT OFFENDER: PROSECUTOR Deputy Public Prosecutor Sean Koh asked for at least 10 months' jail and an enhanced sentence of 237 days. He said Kang is a recalcitrant offender with convictions dating back to 1998. He had committed similar cheating offences in 2018 by going to various karaoke lounges and ordering packages he could not afford. His lawyer asked for a lower sentence, saying that it should still not be ""too far off"" from similar cases of this nature, but the judge agreed with the prosecution's position, saying that Kang has ""a lot"" of past convictions. For each count of cheating, he could have been jailed for up to three years, fined, or both. Because he committed the offences while on remission, he was liable for enhanced sentences."

Liang An Wey, 46, is also accused of attempting to seek a bribe of S$1 million from the chief operating officer of a subcontractor for construction works for SingPost. Liang was given a charge each of corruptly obtaining to gain gratification and of cheating SingPost. According to charge sheets, Liang submitted false information about his past employment and salary when applying for a job at SingPost. He claimed that he had been employed by GSM Holdings between 2012 and June 2013 for a salary of S$14,500. SingPost was deceived into delivering a monthly salary of S$15,000 to Liang for four years and eight months, or a total of S$840,000. Liang was also accused of trying to get a bribe from the chief operating officer of Bintai Kindenko in March 2015. He allegedly asked for the bribe in return for recommending Bintai as a preferred subcontractor for certain works in the construction of SingPost Centre Retail Mall Redevelopment and the SingPost Office Asset Enhancement Initiative. In response to queries from CNA, a spokesperson for SingPost said the company was alerted to Liang's ""activities"" by the relevant authorities in 2017 and gave its full assistance in investigations. ""SingPost had also conducted its own internal inquiry, and dismissed him in April 2018,"" he said. Liang will return to court in June. If convicted of corruption, he can be jailed up to five years, fined up to S$100,000, or both. He could be jailed up to 10 years and fined if convicted of cheating."
Singapore,"Former BP director jailed, ordered to pay more than S$6 million for taking bribes",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/bp-corruption-clarence-chang-koh-seng-lee-pacific-prime-trading-14785880,1620710226,"SINGAPORE: A former director of BP Singapore was jailed for 54 months and ordered to pay a penalty of about S$6.22 million on Tuesday (May 11) for taking bribes. Clarence Chang Peng Hong had suggested that Koh Seng Lee set up Pacific Prime Trading, a petroleum and petroleum products wholesaler, to be a trading counterpart of BP. This was ""on the understanding that Chang would advance the business interest of (Pacific Prime Trading) with BP and would therefore be entitled to payments in return"", said the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) in a press release. Between July 2006 and July 2010, Koh, the executive director of Pacific Prime Trading, gave US$3.95 million (S$5.2 million) to Chang pursuant to their agreement. Koh also agreed to give Chang S$500,000 as a form of investment into an education business franchise that Chang's wife was involved in. Chang and Koh were convicted of corruption in July last year. On Monday, Koh was also sentenced to 54 months' imprisonment. Chang, who was BP's former eastern regional director for marine fuels, separately faces money laundering charges. He allegedly transferred almost S$4.7 million worth of corrupt proceeds from an HSBC bank account in Hong Kong to a POSB account and two other HSBC accounts in Singapore. Chang is suspected of converting nearly S$4 million to buy three private landed properties and two condominium apartments. That amount was wholly or partially the direct or indirect benefits of corrupt proceeds, said CPIB. He was also charged with converting S$111,000 worth of corrupt proceeds to acquire share capital in a pre-school. The money laundering charges were stood down for the purpose of the corruption trial and will be dealt with subsequently, said CPIB. Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence in Singapore can be jailed for up to five years, fined up to S$100,000 or both. Anyone guilty of accepting gratification can also be ordered to pay a penalty equal to the amount of that gratification. Those convicted of a money laundering offence can be jailed for up to seven years, fined up to S$500,000 or both. ""To avoid falling victim to dishonest practices by rogue employees seeking personal gains, companies are strongly advised to put in place robust procedures in areas such as procurement and internal audit,"" said CPIB. Companies can refer to CPIB's guidance on measures to prevent corruption, and are strongly encouraged to obtain certification on anti-bribery management systems, said the bureau."
Singapore,Man admits repeatedly molesting barber as she cut his hair in dormitory,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/dormitory-worker-admits-repeatedly-molesting-barber-14785902,1620709049,"SINGAPORE: A man repeatedly molested a female barber who was cutting his hair at an in-house shop in a foreign workers' dormitory. Indian national Wilson Selvanson, 32, pleaded guilty on Tuesday (May 11) to two counts of outraging the barber's modesty. Another two similar charges will be considered in sentencing. The court heard that Selvanson worked as a welder and stayed at a dormitory. The address was redacted from court documents to protect the victim's identity. The victim was working at the barber shop on Jan 2, 2021, when Selvanson walked in. He said he wanted a hair cut and was told to wait his turn. At about 8pm, he sat in the barber's chair and the victim asked him how he wished to have his hair cut. He gestured that he wanted his hair cut short. As the woman began cutting his hair, Selvanson began asking her personal questions such as her age and whether she could remove her face mask as he wanted to see her face. As she cut Selvanson's hair, he reached out and rubbed her buttock before sliding his hands into her jeans. The woman told him to stop and he withdrew his hand, but asked her: ""Is there a problem?"" The victim was scared but continued to cut his hair. Selvanson then reached under her apron and unbuttoned her jeans before molesting her. Shocked, the victim immediately knelt down and backed away from Selvanson, pleading with him to stop and said she was scared. Selvanson then paid her S$6 for the haircut and asked for her mobile number, but the woman refused. She reported the matter to her supervisor and to the police. Selvanson was subsequently identified with the aid of closed-circuit television footage and dorm management records and was arrested. The prosecution has called for a year's jail and three strokes of the cane. The judge adjourned the case for sentencing and mitigation to a later date. For outraging the victim's modesty, Selvanson could be jailed for up to two years, fined, caned, or given a combination of these punishments."
Asia,2 face trial as China enforces online control amid pandemic,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-internet-censorship-cai-wei-chen-mei-terminus2049-14784990,1620698262,"TAIPEI: More than a year after two amateur computer coders were taken by police from their Beijing homes, they are set to be tried on Tuesday (May 11) in a case that illustrates the Chinese government's growing online censorship and heightened sensitivity to any deviation from the official narrative on its COVID-19 response. Authorities have not said specifically why Chen Mei, 28, and Cai Wei, 27, were arrested in April last year, so friends and relatives can only guess. They believe it was because the two men had set up an online archive to store articles deleted by censors and a related forum where users could skirt real-name registration requirements to chat anonymously. Started in 2018, the archive kept hundreds of censored articles and the forum saw discussions on sensitive issues including the anti-government protests in Hong Kong and complaints about the ruling Communist Party. But what got them in trouble with authorities appears to be archiving articles showing an alternative to China's official narrative about its pandemic response just as the country started facing questions over its handling of the initial outbreak. In keeping the censored articles and providing a place for them to be discussed, the two run afoul of increasingly strict regulations in an already stifling online environment under President Xi Jinping. Just last year hundreds were prosecuted for online speech. Chen and Cai are being prosecuted under a catch-all charge of ""stirring up trouble and picking quarrels"". Chen's older brother, Chen Kun, said the court appointed lawyer notified family last week that their case would be heard on Tuesday. In January last year, the two began archiving articles about a mysterious new illness circulating in Wuhan. For Cai, who is from the area and could not go home to see his family for the Chinese New Year holiday, the news was particularly upsetting. ""A lot of things happened in China then that made us very upset, and he may have been affected by that,"" said his girlfriend, Tang Hongbo. She was also detained but released after 23 days when it became clear she did not know much about the project. ""Every day we were looking at the Internet, and we were all in this tragic mindset."" Xi has made cyberspace governance a priority, and under his direction, the government created its own model to manage the challenges and opportunities of the Internet. China eliminated online anonymity by requiring people to register under what is known as the real name system starting in 2016. Social media accounts are linked to a mobile phone number, which is tied to an individual’s national ID number. A Chinese activist, using court and government records and media reports, tallied more than 750 prosecutions for web speech in 2020 in an online database and posted on a Twitter account named SpeechFreedomCN. He said he runs the database anonymously out of fear of retribution. A friend of Cai, who declined to be named out of fear of retribution, said Cai had grown frustrated with the censorship regime. In response, he and Chen launched the Terminus2049 archive and 2049bbs forum in 2018 as a ""public platform of free exchange"", Cai wrote in a welcome post. ""It's not just the 'real name' system – the deletions of posts, the bans, have reached a point that’s really shocking domestically,"" Cai wrote in another 2018 post. ""When you have to worry about whether you have touched a sensitive keyword in any post you write, how can you really have the brave desire to express yourself?"" On the forum, Cai wrote about movies, music and books he liked. Others discussed more sensitive topics. It was a place to speak without worrying about having posts deleted or getting one's account banned. It did not require a phone number to register, or even an email address. Chen was more low-key but similarly chafed against the censorship system. ""He wants information to flow. He wants quality information to flow freely,"" said Chen Kun, his older brother. ""We have this type of value deep in our bones, the independence of discourse on the Internet and the free transmission of information.""  Cai and Chen met in 2011 at a summer camp hosted by Liren College, a socially conscious educational program. Both self-taught coders, they first started cooperating on a project to archive all the lectures and information from the summer camps, said a friend of both, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution. Authorities shut down Liren in 2014. Terminus2049 primarily housed articles that had been deleted from Wechat and Weibo, popular social media platforms that are subject to regular algorithmic and human censorship. While similar databases existed, most were blocked in China. Terminus2049 was available on Github, a code sharing platform that is not blocked. The topics the archived articles touched on were broad, but they shared a focus on social issues. One was concerned about the expulsion of migrant workers from Beijing after a fire, while another shared questions about a company that falsified data on rabies vaccines. It was only after Cai and Chen got arrested that their families found out from friends and peers what the two had been working on. They suspect that pandemic-related content triggered the arrests, in part because in the weeks before and after their detention, police questioned acquaintances about what the two had done during the outbreak. ""They were told that Chen Mei has family members abroad, has provided foreign organisations with information about the pandemic and is basically handing a knife over to the enemy,"" said Chen Kun, who now lives in France. Police in Beijing did not respond to a faxed request for comment and court-appointed lawyers did not respond to phone calls. Citizen journalist Zhang Zhan also fell afoul of the law after reporting from Wuhan in the early days of the outbreak. She received a four-year sentence in December. The 2049bbs forum, which never had major reach, is now blocked in China. Yet the discussions continue and the records of the forum live on in a site called 2047, set up by a self-described ""person who walks the same path"" and some members of the old forum. Cai's father, who has not seen his son in more than a year, still cannot understand how his son ran afoul of the authorities. ""He didn't say anything bad. He didn't try to organise some protests,"" Cai Jianli said. ""How did this become picking quarrels and stirring up trouble?"""

It comes after a man allegedly used racial slurs and kicked a 55-year-old woman for not wearing a mask while she was brisk walking. Police investigations are ongoing. Mr Lee said he is confident that the police will establish the facts and bring the perpetrator to justice. ""It goes against everything that our multiracial society stands for, and the mutual respect and racial harmony that we hold so dear. It harms our international reputation more than we realise,"" he said. Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said in a Facebook post referencing the alleged attack that while COVID-19 has brought out the best in people in difficult situations, discriminatory behaviour and ""even violent xenophobic attacks"" stemming from fear and intolerance have also been witnessed around the world. ""Let us not allow such behaviour to take root here,"" she said. ""As we battle this unprecedented pandemic, it is more important than ever for our communities to band together and foster stronger cohesion."" Minister for Transport Ong Ye Kung shared Ms Fu's Facebook post. ""It is only by standing together that we can beat this virus. Discrimination and racism (are) worse than the virus,"" said Mr Ong. Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Tan See Leng, who also shared Ms Fu's post, said that the ""angst and apprehension"" during the COVID-19 crisis should not be allowed to divide and overcome people. ""We are better than this,"" he added."
Singapore,Former recruiter given jail for using NRIC details of 207 people to redeem masks,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/former-recruiter-contact-tracer-jail-nric-redeem-207-masks-14780690,1620639300,"SINGAPORE: A contact tracer used NRIC details he had retained from his previous job as a recruiter to illegally redeem 207 reusable face masks given out by the People's Association (PA) at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Emerson Goh Shou En, 32, was given seven months and six weeks' jail and a fine of S$3,000 by a court on Monday (May 10). He pleaded guilty to three charges of cheating the PA, retaining the personal information of 384 people, and leaving his house during the ""circuit breaker"" period to redeem the masks. Another two charges were considered in sentencing. The court heard that Goh was a contact tracer with NTUC FairPrice at the time of the offences. Before that, he was a recruiter with five companies between 2013 and 2020, publishing job openings and advertisements online to look for suitable candidates. Individuals would send him resumes with scanned copies of their National Registration Identity Cards (NRIC) as part of their job applications. Throughout his career in recruiting, Goh did not tell the applicants that he would retain and use the scanned copies of their NRICs for purposes beyond the job applications. In May 2020, the PA began a third round of a nationwide mask collection exercise as part of efforts to provide residents with enough face masks during the pandemic. From May 26 to Jun 14 last year, Singapore residents could collect one reusable mask each from designated vending machines across the country. The machines were automated and allowed people to collect face masks by scanning the barcode on their NRIC, birth certificate or any other Government-issued identification containing a barcode. No further verification was required after the barcode was scanned, and one face mask was issued per NRIC number. On May 26, 2020, Goh used his NRIC to collect his mask from a vending machine at Changi Simei Community Club. Goh realised that there was no further verification required beyond scanning the barcode on his NRIC. He then decided to scan the barcodes on the copies of NRICs belonging to job applicants he had in his phone to redeem more masks. Goh returned to the vending machines at the community club three times between 11.37pm on May 26, 2020 and 6.15pm on May 27, 2020, wearing a white cap to hide his face on two of the occasions. He used NRIC details belonging to 207 people and redeemed the corresponding number of face masks worth S$2,049.30 in total. The constituency director of Changi Simei CC lodged a police report on May 28, 2020, saying that an unidentified man was captured on closed-circuit television collecting reusable face masks from the vending machines. Between May 30, 2020 and Jun 3, 2020, six police reports were lodged by victims saying they could not collect their Government-issued face masks as they had already been redeemed by someone else. The prosecutor called for at least seven months and six weeks' jail and a fine of S$3,000, saying that the case involves exploitation of Government-run automated vending machines that were introduced for greater convenience to Singapore residents. ""Importantly, these face masks were meant for other Singapore citizens seeking to protect themselves and their loved ones from the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Deputy Public Prosecutor Yeow Xuan. ""A deterrent sentence is therefore warranted to deter like-minded persons who may be emboldened to exploit future government distribution exercises that are digitised for the convenience of the community.""  THERE WERE ENOUGH MASKS AT THAT TIME: LAWYER Goh's lawyer Riko Isaac said this was an ""opportunistic crime"" and that his client was ""just making use of information that he had with him at that point in time"". He said Goh did not sell or leak the NRIC information for profit or to cause damage, and had withdrawn the face masks ""during a time where there was no shortage of face masks"". Goh did not take the masks to sell at inflated prices, but instead wanted to protect himself from COVID-19, said the lawyer. Mr Isaac also said PA did not suffer a loss as the masks were recovered from Goh's home. He highlighted Goh's obsessive-compulsive disorder, which results in frequent hand-washing, long baths and using inordinate amounts of soap to wash his hands, but accepted that no contributory or causal link was found between his condition and the offences. ""I will highlight that only six people lodged police reports,"" said Mr Isaac. ""When he went to withdraw the masks, many Singaporeans already purchased masks of their own and this was part of a later Government exercise. By this time there was no shortage of masks."" The judge said there was a need to deter like-minded offenders who might want to exploit such Government distribution exercises, and noted that an Institute of Mental Health report found that Goh was not of unsound mind."
Singapore,"Former UOB, OCBC bank employee jailed for cheating 7 people of nearly S$2 million",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/former-uob-ocbc-bank-employee-jailed-cheating-million-wealth-14780518,1620635466,"SINGAPORE: A former employee at two banks was given seven years' jail on Monday (May 10) for cheating seven people of almost S$2 million for fictitious wealth products. Han Delong, 34, was given the jail term after pleading guilty to 27 charges, including criminal breach of trust as an agent and cheating. Another 67 charges were considered in sentencing. The court heard that Han was a senior personal banker at United Overseas Bank (UOB) between August 2014 and December 2015, selling and marketing the bank's wealth products. He resigned from UOB in December 2015 and joined Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC) in March 2016. He was a premier relationship manager at OCBC until January 2017 and also sold the bank's wealth products. Because of his positions at both banks, Han enjoyed ""a close relationship"" with his former clients and victims, court documents said. Han began approaching former clients and promoting fixed deposits that were not actually offered by the respective banks. He cheated them into handing over sums ranging between S$20,000 and S$350,000 between February 2015 and May 2017. Several of the victims filed police reports, including one of Han's former UOB customers, who transferred S$350,000 to his personal account in February 2016 even though Han no longer worked at UOB at the time. Han issued the victim a forged letter printed with a UOB letterhead for the supposed UOB fixed deposit, and later issued another letter for a ""renewal"" of the fixed deposit. The Commercial Affairs Department uncovered a total of seven victims who had been cheated by Han of S$1,969,000 in total for fictitious fixed deposits or investment products purportedly offered by UOB or OCBC. Han dealt with the money in various ways, including transferring S$17,000 to his brother in February 2016 and transferring multiple batches of S$10,000 to a bank account he held jointly with his ex-girlfriend. He also spent S$11,899 in a cashier's order payable to Premium Automobiles, a car dealer, and transferred about S$20,000 to Singapore Pools. He used about S$350,000 he took from the victims to repay other victims. He has also since made restitution of S$275,000. The judge noted his early plea of guilt and accepted that Han was remorseful and has made partial restitution."

""The Ministry of Law has previously assessed whether the names of accused persons should not be published until they are convicted,"" said Mr Shanmugam in Parliament on Monday. Mr Shanmugam noted two approaches: Protecting the identity of accused persons until they are convicted with rules to grant anonymity to the accused in certain cases; and having open court proceedings where “all matters are out immediately”, which does not provide the courts with a general power to grant accused people anonymity to protect their reputations. “The downside in this second approach is that of course the reputation of accused persons is often irreparably damaged by the publicity arising from media coverage of an ongoing criminal trial, even if they are acquitted at the end of the day,"" he said. ""And I think Dr Tan's question probably arises from the trial of doctors and sex crimes, but this applies to all accused, a variety of cases."" Mr Shanmugam said: ""After assessments, we have decided to keep to our approach, which means that in general, accused persons are publicly tried and the verdict is publicly announced. That also allows unidentified victims of serial offenders, for example, to come forward and seek help. ""But I emphasise our position on this issue is, however, not set in concrete. We can also see the merits of shifting to some version of the first approach. So we will keep reviewing this while we are maintaining status quo."" Under the Ministry of Law's current approach, “there is anonymity given if it is required in public interest” in some circumstances, said the Law Minister. This includes protecting sensitive information related to national security, and the identities of young children or people and alleged victims of sexual or child abuse offences. “But the reason for doing that is to protect those vulnerable victims and children from being identified and give them a better life,"" said Mr Shanmugam. Noting that the courts have the power to prohibit the publication of the identity of the accused and impose some conditions on how the trial can be reported, Mr Shanmugam stressed that the media must also comply with these orders when covering the proceedings. “There are … pros and cons with both approaches, whether to allow or to prohibit the publication of names of accused persons until they are convicted. We will keep our position under review.”"
Singapore,Jail for man who pretended to rent condo unit that was later used by sex worker instead,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/jail-for-man-who-pretended-to-rent-condo-unit-that-was-later-14779768,1620623900,"SINGAPORE: In exchange for cash promised via an online advertisement, a man agreed to sign a tenancy agreement for a condominium unit he never intended to stay in. The unit was eventually used by a sex worker for vice, and she was nabbed during a police raid. Lin Fengchun, 26, was given four weeks' jail and a fine of S$400 on Monday (May 10) for one charge of cheating. Another two charges were taken into consideration. The court heard that Lin was in need of money in October 2019 when he came across an online ad seeking individuals to sign tenancy agreements on another person's behalf in exchange for quick cash. He responded to the ad, and a man identifying himself as ""Da Ge"" contacted Lin on WeChat. Da Ge said he was looking for a unit to rent, but could not as he held only a work permit. Lin agreed to help him rent various apartment units in exchange for payment. Da Ge later gave the address of a condo unit in the eastern part of Singapore to Lin, and arranged for Lin to meet the landlord's property agent on Oct 20, 2019. Lin met the property agent at the unit and pretended that he was working shifts as ground crew at Changi Airport. He said he had a girlfriend who was a flight stewardess and would stay over occasionally. After the agent spoke to the owner of the unit, the latter agreed to lease out the unit to Lin, believing he would be the tenant. Lin signed a tenancy agreement to rent the unit for 12 months from Nov 5, 2019, for a monthly rental of S$2,000. After he signed the agreement, Da Ge transferred 2,000 yuan (S$413) to him via WeChat as payment. On Da Ge's instructions, Lin left the tenancy agreement and keys to the unit inside the home before leaving with the main door unlocked. He did not stay at the unit at any point in time. On Apr 14, 2020, the police raided the unit and arrested a 35-year-old China national for providing sexual services inside the unit. Lin had cheated the owner of the unit into believing that he was renting it and that he would observe all covenants contained in the tenancy agreement, including that he would use it only as a private dwelling house and not for any immoral or illegal purpose. The prosecutor called for at least four weeks' jail and a fine of S$415, which was about the amount he received from Da Ge. Defence lawyer Tay Jing En, who took the case on under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, asked for a large fine of between S$5,000 and S$6,000 instead of a jail term. He said his client has no previous convictions and that there is ""no evidence that he knew what the unit he rented was to be used for"". ""I would also highlight that he has been issued with rather glowing testimonials particularly by his National Service commander,"" he said. He added that his client accepts that he ""acted foolishly, unthinkingly, stupidly even"" but said he did not do it maliciously. The judge granted him a deferment of his sentence to May 12. For cheating, Lin could have been jailed up to three years, fined, or both."
Singapore,"Police investigating case of a man who allegedly used racial slurs, kicked woman for not wearing mask",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-racial-slur-kick-woman-mask-brisk-walk-police-investigate-14779652,1620623030,"SINGAPORE: Police are investigating a case in which a man allegedly used racial slurs and kicked a 55-year-old woman for not wearing a mask while she was brisk walking. Mdm Hindocha Nita Vishnubhai was brisk walking on Friday (May 7) morning when a man approached her and asked her to pull her mask up from her chin, said her daughter, Ms Parveen Kaur. Mdm Nita was walking along Choa Chu Kang Drive when the man came up to her near a bus stop outside Northvale condominium. ""She explained that she was brisk walking but he didn't care. He hurled vulgarities and racial slurs at her,"" said Ms Kaur in a widely circulated Instagram Stories post. ""My mum responded with a 'God bless you' and the guy kicked her in the chest. My mum landed on her back and hurt herself."" The man ran away while her mother was left shaken and bleeding, said Ms Kaur. Ms Kaur said her mother brisk walks to work as a form of daily exercise, but the incident has left her ""afraid of taking a walk in her own country"". The incident came to light during a Mother's Day dinner on Sunday, when Ms Kaur learnt what happened and took photographs of her mother's injuries. The photographs show bloodied scrapes and bruises on Mdm Nita's elbow, arms and palms.  A report on the incident was lodged and investigations are ongoing, police said on Monday. All people in Singapore aged six and above are required to wear a mask when outside their homes, according to Ministry of Health guidelines. They may remove their mask while engaging in outdoor or strenuous exercise, including brisk walking or walking up hilly terrain, but must put it back on after exercising. Those walking at a normal pace are required to wear a mask."
Singapore,"Father molested 11-year-old daughter while punishing her for failing exams, gets jail and caning",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/father-molested-11-year-old-daughter-punishing-examinations-14779638,1620621258,"SINGAPORE: While punishing his 11-year-old daughter for failing her examinations, a 34-year-old man began molesting her when he pulled her shirt up. He ""kept on thinking"" about the incident and called her in for another ""punishment"" only to molest her again. The offender, who cannot be named to protect the identity of his now 15-year-old daughter, was given two years' jail and six strokes of the cane on Monday (May 10). The court heard that the man lived with his wife and three children at the time of the offences. Apart from the victim, the couple has two sons. Sometime in December 2017, the victim was watching television in the living room with her brothers when her father called her into the master bedroom. He wanted to punish her as she had failed her year-end examinations. After the door was closed, he asked his daughter to sit on the floor and close her eyes. He began pinching and slapping her all over her body except for her face. When he pulled her shirt up to her armpit, her bra came unhooked, exposing her chest. The man continued his ""punishment"" by pinching and slapping her chest, later admitting that he had the ""desire"" to touch her breasts when he saw them. When the victim asked if the punishment was over, the accused said ""yes"" and let her go. HE WANTED TO MOLEST HER AGAIN After the incident, the man ""kept on thinking"" about his daughter's chest. As he wanted to molest her again, he called her into the master bedroom again the following day. The girl had been reading a book in her room, but went to her father's bedroom as instructed, while her brothers were in the living room. The offender asked the victim to close her eyes after closing the bedroom door, before unhooking her bra. He then molested her. After waiting for about two minutes, the victim asked her father is the punishment was over, but he replied that it was not over yet. Feeling uncomfortable, the victim opened her eyes and began crying as she was afraid. Her father then told her the punishment was over and she could leave. The crimes came to light in January 2018, after the girl told a friend in school what had happened and the school was alerted to the incident. The victim's mother was informed and the girl was taken to a hospital, where staff members later alerted the authorities about a case of sexual assault. The prosecutor sought at least two years' jail and six strokes of the cane for the man. She said the degree of sexual exploitation was high, with skin-on-skin contact that cannot be described as fleeting. There was also deliberation on the man's part, as he had asked the victim to go into the master bedroom and closed the door so that she was separated from her two brothers. He had perpetuated the ""highest form of abuse of trust"", she added. WIFE HAS DIVORCED HIM: DEFENCE Defence lawyer Shehzhadee Rahman of IRB Law asked that the jail term be no more than 20 months, saying this was her client's first brush with the law. She added that he had an IQ of only 78, which falls within the borderline impaired or delayed range. He is ""deeply contrite"" for his offences, she said. The incidents have caused his family ""to break apart"", which is ""very painful for him"", she said. His wife has since divorced him and his entire family ""torn apart"", said the lawyer, adding that her client feels ""very disgusted"" at himself and will never be able to forgive himself. ""Up till this incident he (was) a very loving father,"" she said. In response, the prosecutor said the Institute of Mental Health psychiatrist had found that the offender was lucid and in full control of his faculties at the time of the offences and knew what he wanted and what he was doing, despite his low IQ. On his family being ""torn apart"", she said: ""That's the result of the accused's own actions."" The judge granted the accused his request for a deferment and will hear the case again later on Monday afternoon to decide how to take into account the two weeks he spent in IMH remand. He could have been jailed up to five years, fined, caned, or given any combination of these penalties for molesting a minor."
Singapore,5 men investigated for suspected involvement in sexual services scams,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/sexual-services-scam-facebook-locanto-skokka-crime-police-14768154,1620448830,"SINGAPORE: Five men, aged 19 to 50, are being investigated for their suspected involvement in five cases of sexual services scams, the police said on Saturday (May 8). Between March and April, the police received several reports from victims who responded to online platforms offering sexual services, but did not receive those services after payments were made. An islandwide operation was conducted on Monday and Tuesday by officers from the Commercial Affairs Department, supported by police land divisions. Officers rounded up five men whose bank accounts were allegedly used to receive money from victims of such scams, said the police in a news release. One of the men is allegedly a victim of a sexual service scam himself. Preliminary investigations showed that victims usually received unsolicited friend requests from the scammers on social media platforms like Facebook or Tagged. Victims also befriended the scammers through online listings on classifieds website Locanto and escort service directory Skokka. The scammers would then chat with the victims on other messaging platforms like Telegram. They would ask the victims for payments before meeting up. Payments were usually made via bank transfers or mobile applications like PayNow or PayLah, said the police.  In one case where the man under investigation is an alleged victim of a scam, the scammer purportedly requested that he allow his bank account to receive money as well. The scammer claimed this was to remit money overseas via a remittance agency, citing a family emergency as a reason. ""Unbeknown to the man, the money he received was purportedly from a victim of a sexual service scam as well,"" said the police. ""By allegedly assisting to receive and transfer money from tainted sources, the men may have acted as money mules and purportedly facilitated money laundering."" The offence of money laundering carries a jail term of up to 10 years, a fine of up to S$500,000 or both. Investigations are ongoing. The police reminded members of the public to be wary of friend requests or online listings offering escort, massage or sexual services, as they may be fraudulent in nature. The public is also reminded not to disclose bank account details to anyone for the purpose of receiving money of unknown origins. Those with information on such scams can call the police hotline at 1800 255 0000, the anti-scam hotline at 1800 722 6688 or submit it online."
Singapore,'Additional discovery' reviewed as Amos Yee remanded by US court on child porn charges,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/amos-yee-court-child-porn-charges-additional-discovery-14765608,1620429494,"SINGAPORE: There has been an “additional discovery” in the case of Singaporean Amos Yee, who has been remanded in the US. Yee, 22, appeared via Zoom before a Chicago court on early Saturday morning (May 8) Singapore time for a short status hearing. Dressed in an orange jumpsuit and a surgical face mask, he did not speak and only nodded when addressed by the judge and lawyers. In November last year, Yee pleaded not guilty to all charges related to his arrest for child pornography. The public defender - a lawyer employed by the state in a criminal trial to represent a defendant who is unable to afford legal assistance - said he needed to visit Yee in remand to go over some matters with him. “We did get an additional discovery that I was able to review and I need to go over that with Mr Yee. But I do believe we will likely have a disposition to this matter,” said lawyer Ali Ammoura, without specifying what the discovery was. Yee is set to come before the court again on Jun 2, when a disposition is expected. A disposition is a court’s final determination in a criminal charge. Yee was granted asylum in the United States four years ago. He was arrested by US Marshals on Oct 14, 2020 at his apartment in Chicago’s Norwood Park East neighbourhood. Police have charged him with child pornography and grooming, alleging that he exchanged nude photos with a 14-year-old Texas girl via WhatsApp. The alleged incidents took place in 2019 between Feb 1 and Jun 30, and involved thousands of texts. When their relationship soured, the girl reached out to a group of people “interested in exposing paedophiles”, the court previously heard. Yee has been in remand since his arrest, with a US$1 million bond. If found guilty, Yee could lose his asylum status and be deported back to Singapore. This is not Yee’s first brush with the law. In 2015, Yee was jailed in Singapore for wounding religious feelings by making remarks about Christians. About a year later, Yee was jailed again and fined on a similar charge, this time for making remarks about Christians and Muslims. In 2017, Yee was granted asylum in the US by a US immigration court, despite opposition from the Department of Homeland Security."

Fathullah Abdul Rahman, 22, was given three charges under the Infectious Diseases Act for leaving his home while under the conditions of a medical certificate. According to charge sheets, he was given a medical certificate indicating that he had acute respiratory infection symptoms. He was required to stay at home between Sep 2 and Sep 4 last year, according to the certificate issued by a doctor at the Civil Defence Academy Complex Medical Centre. Fathullah is accused of leaving his home and travelling via MRT and a bus to IKEA in Tampines. The next morning, he allegedly left his house and met a woman at Bedok MRT before going to the Kallang area with her. On Sep 17, 2020, the same doctor issued Fathullah another medical certificate for the same symptoms. Although he was required to stay home for three days until Sep 19, 2020, Fathullah allegedly left home to go to the Singapore Expo. He will return to court in June and is set to plead guilty. For each charge, he can be jailed for up to six months, fined up to S$10,000, or both, if he is a first-time offender.

Singapore,"Woman who made 'sovereign' remark, refused to wear mask gets jail and fine",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/woman-sovereign-remark-refuse-mask-shunfu-market-jail-fine-14762778,1620379829,"SINGAPORE: A woman who caused a commotion at a market during the ""circuit breaker"" period last year by refusing to wear a mask and calling herself a ""sovereign"" was sentenced to two weeks' jail and a fine of S$2,000 on Friday (May 7). Paramjeet Kaur, 41, pleaded guilty to a charge each of causing a public nuisance and of failing to wear a mask. Another five charges including occasions where she failed to wear a mask were considered in sentencing. As Kaur had previously been remanded at the Institute of Mental Health for two weeks with no mental disorder found, she will not have to serve any additional jail time.  Kaur, who had her mask below her nose throughout her time in court, claimed that she suffered from asthma and did not want to wear a mask as she thought it would affect her ability to breathe. Her lawyer also told the court that his client, a physiotherapist who lived for many years in Australia, has been ""humiliated"" as well as ""harassed"" by reporters and commenters on social media. The court heard that Kaur went to the wet market section at the basement of a hawker centre at Blk 320, Shunfu Road on the morning of May 3, 2020, to buy groceries. She deliberately went near the closing time as she wanted to avoid any crowd, her lawyers said. LACK OF MASK DREW ATTENTION FROM ONLOOKERS Kaur was not wearing a mask at the time and drew the attention of several people at the market. A woman whose parents owned a stall at the market confronted Kaur and told her she should be wearing a mask. Kaur retorted that she did not need to wear a mask as she was not sick, said the prosecutor. By 12.16pm, the exchange had led to an argument and a commotion, as Kaur was ""defiant and adamant"" on not wearing a mask. The other woman called the police. Hawker stall owners and customers at the wet market were drawn to the scene, with at least seven witnesses listed in court documents. Kaur was shouting loudly and said the police could not do anything to her, and that she was a ""sovereign"". She also said she was not a person, but ""we the people"", the court heard. This behaviour caused annoyance to those there, said Deputy Public Prosecutor V Jesudevan. Kaur also refused to wear a mask that was offered to her by someone in the crowd. PROSECUTOR CALLS FOR JAIL AND MAXIMUM FINE Mr Jesudevan asked for two weeks' jail for the mask offence and the maximum fine of S$2,000 for the public nuisance charge. He said Kaur was ""an openly defiant person in the face of law enforcement being present and the glare of the public"". ""One must also bear in mind what she uttered here - when she uttered that she was sovereign, we take it to be that she is referring to a movement in the US, which its adherence ... rejects Government, rejects authority and rejects police,"" he said. He said the charges taken into consideration involve Kaur travelling some distance without a mask. Taking aim at the defence's arguments and reliance on private psychiatric reports claiming that Kaur suffers from asthma and depression, Mr Jesudevan said the IMH did not find that Kaur had any mental disorder. Referring to a 2013 medical report the defence tendered indicating acute bronchitis in Kaur, the prosecutor pointed out that Kaur had left the clinic without her medicine or an asthma management plan, which shows it could not have been very serious. Another diagnosis was given by a doctor in Australia in October 2020 while Kaur was in Singapore, and ""it's curious to see how the doctor is able to physically diagnose her"", said Mr Jesudevan. He added that if Kaur had complied with a doctor's order to use an inhaler, he did not see why she could not wear a mask. None of the doctors' notes said she was not in a position to don a mask, he said. ""Certainly, she's wearing one now, even though it's not covering her nose,"" he said. He added that reports relied on by the defence showed that Kaur was not eventually diagnosed with depression, even though she had previously been given antidepressants. DEFENCE HIGHLIGHTS DIFFICULT CHILDHOOD, PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES Defence lawyer Kertar Singh sought a fine, saying his client had ""a very difficult childhood"", with her father leaving the matrimonial home when she was four or five. Her mother raised her and her younger brother single-handedly, but she was ""motivated to excel"" despite this, he said. She did a course in biotechnology in Ngee Ann Polytechnic and left Singapore in 2001 for Canberra, where she obtained a bachelor's degree in applied science and later took a master's degree. She worked as a physiotherapist in Australia before returning to Singapore in 2008 to be closer to her mother. After her return, she tried to find a job in Singapore, but failed to do so. ""In 2020, the COVID-19 situation made things even worse for her,"" said Mr Singh. ""It changed the social and economic landscape, which adversely affected her, and it was during this period sometime in late January 2020, in the midst of a nationwide panic to stock up on masks, where the (multi-ministry taskforce) said to wear a mask only if you are sick and need to see a doctor."" He said this was the first impression that Kaur got, and the Government subsequently changed their stance on the use of masks. The offence was committed days after the Government mandated the wearing of masks when leaving the home, said Mr Singh. He pointed to the ""extent of humiliation"" his client received from the crowd at the market, taking pictures and videos of her and shouting at her. ""Pam felt frightened and terrified,"" he said. He added that she thought wearing a mask would hinder her ability to breathe normally or comfortably. He said the police investigations as well as her remand at IMH amounted to a traumatic experience for her and have left an indelible impression on her.  HUMILIATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA ""Further, your honour, the matter appears to have attracted an unhealthy level of publicity. Given her fragile state of mind, she is unable to cope with the humiliation from social media, badgering by members of the public,"" said Mr Singh. He added that his client has ""suffered in silence"" and seeks to put this episode behind her, but is worried that the social media bullying will continue even after she has paid the price. She has since been careful to adhere to the measures and ""has been dutifully wearing a mask when she leaves home"", said Mr Singh. When his colleague tried to argue about how the members of the public had chosen to gather around Kaur during the pandemic, the judge pointed out that she had drawn attention to herself by not wearing a mask. District Judge Ronald Gwee said the incidents demonstrate ""an egregious disregard for provisions that were imposed for the safety of everyone during the early days of the most serious aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic"". ""Such provisions were made public and there's no reason for anyone to state that they were not aware of such provisions and more so to be in blatant disregard and disobedience of such provisions,"" he said. For not wearing a mask without reasonable excuse, Kaur could have been jailed up to six months, fined up to S$10,000, or both. For public nuisance, she could have been fined up to S$2,000."
Singapore,"Daewoo director, project manager plead guilty to bribing former LTA deputy group director",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/daewoo-director-project-manager-plead-guilty-bribe-lta-14762360,1620373970,"SINGAPORE: A director and a project manager at an engineering and construction firm pleaded guilty on Friday (May 7) to giving S$50,000 in bribes to a deputy group director with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) who oversaw a project they were hired for. Kim Young-Gyu, a 52-year-old director of Daewoo Engineering and Construction, and Ro Sungyoung, a 49-year-old project manager of the same firm, pleaded guilty to a charge each of conspiring to bribe the LTA's Henry Foo Yung Thye with S$30,000. Each man will have a second charge involving another S$20,000 taken into consideration for sentencing. They are the first to plead guilty in a wide-ranging corruption case where Foo, who was the deputy group director of the Thomson-East Coast and Cross-Island Lines, is accused of taking about S$1.24 million in bribes. The court heard that the LTA awarded the main contract for the construction of the Stevens MRT Station to Daewoo in April 2014 for S$441 million. This was the first time Daewoo was awarded a project in Singapore, and both Kim and Ro worked on it, reporting to Foo for official quarterly meetings with the LTA. Foo was not only in charge of the Stevens MRT Station construction, but also as a member of the tender steering committee and chairman of the tender evaluation committee for the project. He was also the engineer of the project and had powers to commit the LTA to additional expenditures. In 2015, after the LTA awarded the tender to Daewoo, Kim and Ro began communicating frequently with Foo. At the outset, Ro thought Foo was ""difficult to talk to"" and demanding towards Daewoo as the main contractor. In June or July 2018, Foo contacted Ro and told him he had financial problems, asking for a loan. Afraid to offend Foo, a high-ranking LTA officer, Ro said he would discuss the matter with Kim, his boss.  When Kim heard about it, he said he rejected the notion angrily, as he knew Daewoo had strong compliance policies prohibiting monetary payments to clients. He also knew such payments would be against Singapore law and claims that he was ""shocked"" that a Singapore-based client such as Foo would ask for money from his contractor. However, Foo kept repeating the request to Ro. The court heard that Kim instructed Ro to reject Foo by claiming that Daewoo had financial difficulties, but Foo was undeterred. THEY SUCCUMB TO HIS REQUEST FOR A BRIBE Subsequently, Kim and Ro decided they could no longer reject Foo in view of his position at the LTA and in the project. By agreeing to his request for a loan, they hoped it would put them on friendly terms with Foo and facilitate the smooth progress of works on the train station. Kim said he feared that if they offended Foo, he would ""apply time-pressure"" on Daewoo for the project and influence the LTA's inspections of their work, leading to the firm having to redo some works. Ro also thought a favourable relationship with Foo was important, as he said Foo had been demanding on Daewoo in their compliance with safety and environmental regulations. The court also heard that the pair had hoped that the loan would stand them in good stead to be awarded future projects from the LTA, especially in comparison with other contractors who had not given money to Foo. Kim told Ro he would leave it to him to decide how much to give and how to raise the money, promising him that he would be offered the role of project director with a S$5,000 increase in gross monthly pay from his current salary of S$15,000. They said they were both unsure if Foo would repay Ro. On Dec 31, 2018, Foo texted Ro and said he needed to urgently raise a sum of money for family issues. After speaking to Kim and with his agreement, Ro lent Foo S$30,000. In response, Foo sent a text message saying: ""Many thanks to you and Kim. ... Really appreciative again, Ro."" Foo mentioned he would return the money, but did not give a specific date and never repaid it. RO AND KIM TRY TO ASK FOR FAVOURS On May 3, 2019, Ro contacted Foo, asking for the latter's help to cover up certain infringements of safety or cleanliness at the train station work site. An LTA officer had inspected it and given Daewoo a negative score. Ro wanted to get Foo's help as he was concerned that the matter would negatively impact Daewoo's ongoing tender bid for a project on the Jurong Region Line. Instead of rejecting Ro, Foo said he would help him by speaking to the LTA's group director of safety and contracts, feeling indebted to Ro and Kim for the money they lent him. However, his intervention did not change the negative score, and Daewoo was not eventually awarded the Jurong Region Line project. Around August 2019, Kim asked Ro to find out from Foo why Daewoo had failed in the first stage of the LTA tendering process for the construction of tunnels at Changi Airport, so that Kim could report back to Daewoo's South Korean headquarters about its failure. Ro sent Foo a WhatsApp message asking for the explanation. Foo sent him a screenshot of the LTA tender evaluation committee's assessment, and the reason for Daewoo failing. He told Ro not to forward the image to anybody as it was confidential. When the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau caught wind of the corruption and first interviewed Ro, he was not forthcoming about the amount of bribes given. At first, he claimed it was from a subcontractor of Daewoo, KGM Brothers Contractors. But the latter denied it and their accounts were clean. Ro later admitted that he had paid the bribe to Foo using his personal rental income from a piece of property in Seoul. Neither Kim nor Ro reported the incident to Daewoo's headquarters. Deputy Public Prosecutors Victoria Ting and Kelvin Chong asked for eight months' jail for both Kim and Ro, saying they had ""disregarded and seriously undermined the integrity of a contract relating to a public body"". The bribe was substantial, and Foo was a senior officer within the LTA, they said. The two men were motivated by gaining unfair advantages for their company in at least two ways: To be treated favourably during the LTA inspections, and to be favoured for future contracts. Kim and Ro will return for sentencing later this month, while Foo is set for a pre-trial conference in June. He faces 36 charges that range from taking bribes from contractors or subcontractors to cheating his colleagues into giving him loans between 2008 and 2019. The cases for several other co-accused are pending."
Singapore,Man who chopped down town council's papaya tree and threatened cat feeder gets jail,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/papaya-tree-chopped-threatened-cat-feeder-jail-14762034,1620365867,"SINGAPORE: A man who chopped down a papaya tree belonging to a town council and waved the weapon at a nearby cat feeder was given three weeks' jail on Friday (May 7). Ang Say Chee, 60, pleaded guilty to one charge of criminal intimidation by raising a chopper at the cat feeder. Another two charges were taken into consideration: Chopping down half a papaya tree belonging to the Bishan-Toa Payoh Town Council and causing wrongful loss to the public in an act of mischief; and burning a red cloth in a rash act endangering personal safety. The court heard that Ang lived in a flat at Toa Payoh Lorong 4. At about 2.30pm on Aug 6, 2019, he placed a chopper in a plastic bag and went to the void deck of Block 56, which was near his home. He hacked down a large papaya tree there as he believed the tree was possessed by evil spirits. A 70-year-old woman who was nearby and about to feed a stray cat heard the tree falling. She saw Ang walking away from the tree and towards the cat she was about to feed. When Ang saw her, he tried to snatch a container of cat biscuits that she was holding, and it fell from her hands. He said ""dirty dirty"" and told her he wanted to call the police, and she replied that she would wait for the officers to arrive. Ang took out the chopper from his plastic bag and raised it above his head. He pointed the weapon at the victim's head and told her he was unhappy that she was feeding the neighbourhood cats. The victim called the police for help and retreated, hiding behind a pillar while Ang sat on a stone bench and later threw the chopper away. The weapon was not recovered. The police arrested Ang when they arrived. The prosecutor asked for at least three weeks' jail, noting that Ang had used a chopper with the intent to cause alarm, but that there was no overt threat. He also did not pursue the victim, but discarded the weapon. However, Ang has a string of past convictions from 1979 for crimes ranging from housebreaking, taking an intoxicant into a public hospital, mischief, affray, rape and rash acts endangering life or safety. For criminal intimidation, he could have been jailed up to two years, fined, or both."

Singapore,Malaysian woman admits performing invasive nose treatment illegally in Singapore hotel,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/malaysian-woman-admits-invasive-nose-treatment-thread-lift-hotel-14755868,1620297030,"SINGAPORE: A Malaysian beauty consultant came to Singapore to perform illegal invasive beauty procedures on customers, administering a local anaesthetic and prescribing medication out of a hotel room on one occasion. One of her customers, who hired the beauty consultant for a nose thread lift procedure, reported the woman to the Ministry of Health (MOH) after the treatment. The nose augmentation procedure involves inserting threads into the nose to enhance the shape of it. Tan Shu Min, 26, pleaded guilty on Thursday (May 6) to three charges under the Health Products Act of importing health products without a valid licence, one charge under the Medical Registration Act of performing a nose thread lift procedure when she was not a registered medical practitioner and another under the Poisons Act of importing syringes containing lignocaine, a local anaesthetic. Another 10 charges will be considered in sentencing. The court heard that Tan was working in Malaysia when she decided that she could make better earnings in Singapore after converting the currency into ringgit. She thought that Singapore has a better market for beauty procedures for botox and filler, the court heard. In early 2019, she began advertising her services for botox, filler injections and other beauty treatments on Instagram, by posting before and other photos she found on the Internet. In January 2019, a victim chanced upon the Instagram account sg_aesthetics26 and sent a WhatsApp message to Tan asking about her beauty treatments. They agreed to meet at Genting Jurong Hotel at 11am on Jan 27, 2019. A few days before that, Tan entered Singapore from Malaysia via Tuas Checkpoint and checked in to the hotel. She met the victim on the planned date, and the victim noticed that Tan was in the middle of attending to an unidentified customer when she arrived. She asked the victim to lie down, and put on surgical gloves, cleaned the victim's nose bridge with alcohol and injected lidocaine into her nose before inserting more than five threads inside. As there was mild swelling around the victim's nose, Tan gave her two types of oral medication that she claimed were antibiotics. The victim paid her S$400 to S$600 for the procedure, the court heard. After this, Tan suggested via WhatsApp that the victim consider adding more threads for a more defined look. Subsequently, the victim sent MOH an email to say that a Malaysian woman was offering illegal aesthetic treatments such as fillers and augmentation for double eyelids and breasts and advertising the services on an Instagram account. After receiving feedback, the authorities conducted a joint inspection and nabbed Tan, seizing syringes containing lidocaine. Tan was not registered with the Singapore Medical Council and did not have any certificate authorising her to carry out those procedures. PROSECUTION SEEKING SIX MONTHS' JAIL AND FINE The case was handled jointly by prosecutors from MOH and the Health Sciences Authority. The MOH prosecutor called for at least six months' jail for charges under the ministry's purview, and the HSA prosecutor asked for fines for the charges of importing health products without a licence. MOH prosecutor Andre Moses Tan highlighted Tan's motive for profit and the fact that she entered Singapore to commit the offence. ""She targeted Singaporean residents on the basis that with the exchange rate she would earn higher profits than in Malaysia,"" he said. The defence asked for four weeks' jail and a lower fine, saying his client was extremely remorseful and that her period of offending was not more than five months. She has been ""bouncing between Singapore and Johor where her family is based"" and has spent a lot of time in her life in Singapore, he said. The judge adjourned sentencing to May 28."
Singapore,Woman arrested for allegedly using credit card that she stole while at workplace for job interview,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/woman-arrested-stole-credit-card-job-interview-14755916,1620296530,"SINGAPORE: Police on Thursday (May 6) arrested a 30-year-old woman who allegedly used a credit card that she stole while she was at a workplace for a job interview. The police received a report on Tuesday from a victim who discovered several unauthorised transactions had been made with her missing credit card. Officers from Commercial Affairs Department established the identity of the 30-year-old woman and arrested her on Thursday. Preliminary investigations revealed that the woman had attended a job interview at the victim's workplace and had allegedly ""misappropriated the victim's credit card"", the police said. She allegedly used the card to make more than 20 unauthorised transactions amounting to more than S$5,000. ""Some of the items that were purchased using the victim’s credit card included two necklaces and two wallets. The necklaces and wallets were recovered and seized as case exhibits,"" said the police. The woman will be charged in court on Friday with cheating. If convicted, she could be jailed for up to 10 years and fined. The police reminded members of the public to take steps to prevent the unauthorised use of their credit or debit cards. This includes opting for an SMS notification to be sent to their mobile phones for any charges incurred on their cards, checking their bank statements regularly and alerting the bank if they spot discrepancies or unauthorised charges."
Singapore,Workshop owner charged with performing illegal vehicle modifications,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/workshop-owner-charged-illegal-vehicle-modifications-14755628,1620291649,"SINGAPORE: The 39-year-old owner of a motor workshop in Ubi was charged in court on Thursday (May 6) with three counts of performing illegal vehicle modifications. Raymond Tan Chia Long, the owner of Fong Kim Exhaust Racing Development, was charged under the Road Traffic Act with replacing the exhaust systems of two cars with unapproved systems on three separate occasions. Court documents show the alleged offences occurred in June 2019, September last year and March this year, with one car getting its exhaust system replaced twice. For performing illegal vehicle modifications, first-time offenders face a fine of up to S$5,000, up to three months in jail, or both. The penalties are doubled for repeat offenders. Modifying a vehicle illegally is a serious offence, said the Land Transport Authority (LTA) in a media release on Thursday. “Such illegal exhaust modification affects the durability and reliability of the vehicle, and increases the safety risks to both the driver and other road users,” said the LTA. Such modifications can also result in excessive noise, causing public nuisance, it added. The agency noted that motorists must seek its approval before modifying exhaust systems. “Only certified exhaust systems, which have undergone stringent testing in compliance with international standards, and are compatible with that particular make and model of the vehicle will be allowed,” it said. “These exhaust systems are also required to meet the prevailing noise and exhaust emission requirements set by the National Environment Agency.” It added that vehicle owners should check if their planned modifications comply with LTA’s guidelines before proceeding. Information on vehicle modifications are available on the agency’s One Motoring website. “LTA takes a serious view of illegal modifications as they may pose serious safety and environmental hazards,” it said. Senior Minister of State for Transport Amy Khor said in Parliament in March that stricter penalties and regular enforcement have reduced the number of illegal vehicle modifications in Singapore, from about 1,800 per month in 2015 to around 550 per month last year. In the past two years, LTA has issued an average of 610 notices of offences per month to owners of illegally modified vehicles, said Dr Khor then. Separately, a five-day operation by the authorities in March - which came after a car crash in Tanjong Pagar which killed five people - found 54 offences related to illegal vehicle modifications."
Singapore,"Woman fined for selling Malaysia-imported weight loss pills that contained 'poison' on Qoo10, Shopee, Instagram",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/woman-fined-selling-weight-loss-pills-online-sibutramine-poison-14755474,1620287814,"SINGAPORE: After trying out a weight loss product and finding it effective, a woman began importing bottles of the pills from Malaysia and selling them online to customers in Singapore via Qoo10, Shopee and Instagram. However, the Clinic K pills contained sibutramine, a substance banned in Singapore since 2010 because of an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes. After a customer reported to the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) about developing a rapid heartbeat, breathlessness and dizziness after taking the pills for two days, the seller was nabbed. Maithili Vijayakumar, 37, was fined S$6,000 by a court on Thursday (May 6) for one charge of possessing for sale 13 bottles of capsules that contained sibutramine, a poison listed under the Poisons Act. If she does not pay the fine, she will have to serve three weeks' jail in default. The court heard that Maithili ordered the pills in January 2020 for her own consumption. They were marketed to be of ""safe medical grade"" and as the ""No. 1 clinical weight-loss formula in Korea"", containing natural ingredients like amino acids and green tea extract. As Maithili found the pills effective, she began ordering more from her Malaysian supplier in Ipoh for her online account, Misty Beauty Bar, which operated on Qoo10, Shopee and Instagram. She bought more than 200 bottles for S$55 per bottle and marked up the prices to either S$99 or S$110 for each and sold most of them over two-and-a-half months. Maithili earned between S$8,000 and S$10,000 in profits. One of her customers bought a bottle for S$110 from Qoo10 in May 2020 and developed a rapid heartbeat, dizziness and other symptoms. Even after halving the dose and later discontinuing the consumption of the pills, the symptoms persisted and the woman made a report to the HSA. The authority analysed the pills and found high levels of sibutramine in them. The substance was previously a prescription-only medicine for weight loss, and was banned in Singapore since 2010 because of the increased risk of heart attacks and strokes. The level of sibutramine found in the product was double the maximum daily dose previously allowed. The marketing materials included a ""warning"" of potential effects such as nausea, dizziness, restlessness and rapid heartbeat due to the product's ""caffeine content"", but the effects are in fact associated with sibutramine. When the HSA inspected Maithili's home in June 2020, they found 13 bottles of Clinic K with 780 capsules in total and seized them. The prosecutor called for a fine of S$7,000, saying that Maithili had leveraged three online platforms with a wide pool of customers, and that adverse effects were reported in one customer. Maithili's defence lawyer urged for a fine less than S$7,000, saying his client is remorseful and had stopped selling the pills when notified by the HSA. She could have been jailed up to two years and fined up to S$10,000 for contravening the Poisons Act."
Singapore,"Repeat offender gets jail for taking upskirt videos of girls, women near SUSS, SIM and train stations",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/repeat-offender-gets-jail-for-taking-upskirt-videos-of-girls-14754736,1620277909,"SINGAPORE: Eight months after being released from probation for taking upskirt clips, a man resumed his voyeuristic ways, heading to train stations and going to schools to record videos of women and girls. Marcus Phua Xie Yi, 24, was given 15 weeks' jail on Thursday (May 6) after pleading guilty to 15 charges of insulting a woman's modesty, with another 28 charges taken into consideration. The court heard that Phua had been sentenced to 18 months' probation in 2016 for insulting a woman's modesty. However, he started taking upskirt videos again during his National Service, between May 2018 and October 2018. He went to places like the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) and the Singapore Institute of Management, as well as Clementi, Raffles Place and Dover train stations to target female victims. He would not only film under their skirts, but attempt to capture their faces as well, with the judge calling his actions ""brazen"". On Oct 12, 2018, a male student was walking up the stairs at an overhead bridge near SUSS when he noticed Phua in front of him behaving suspiciously and walking closely behind a woman. The male student saw Phua placing his phone near the woman's skirt, before walking past her and shifting his camera to angle it towards her face. After noting that Phua did not walk down the stairs at the other end of the overhead bridge, he spoke to some of his classmates and told them what happened. One of them confronted Phua before calling the police. Phua was arrested and his laptop revealed multiple upskirt videos he had taken of other victims. He would typically trail a victim from behind and take an upskirt video while she was on an escalator or staircase, before filming her face where possible. Defence lawyer Cory Wong of Invictus Law tried to ask for a report assessing if Phua would be suitable for a mandatory treatment order, but the prosecution objected to this. District Judge Marvin Bay said he agreed there was no basis for this, adding that ""at some point one has to draw the line"", referring to how Phua had reoffended and that it is important to ""preserve the privacy of women and girls"". Mr Wong highlighted that his client suffered from major depressive disorder. While this did not contribute to the offences, and he retained a high degree of control over his actions, Mr Wong said Phua was a ""vulnerable person"". His brother died at the age of 10, when Phua was 12, and Phua's father also died of cancer when Phua was 18 or 19, the lawyer explained. Mr Wong highlighted how Phua was under ""a shadow of early deaths"". Judge Bay said he accepted Phua's condition, but said there is a need to ensure that girls and women ""feel free to use public transport and public thoroughfares without any fear that their privacy is not surreptitiously being intruded upon"". ""I also accept that he had a maladaptive coping mechanism using voyeurism to handle personal tragedies,"" added Judge Bay, but said Phua had failed to take the opportunity to reform when he was on probation. For each charge of insulting a woman's modesty, he could have been jailed up to a year and fined."

CNA Insider,"Every 7.4 seconds, a woman in China faces domestic violence. Can the tide be turned?",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/every-7-4-seconds-women-china-face-domestic-violence-patriarchy-14744216,1620252900,"BEIJING: After enduring six years of attacks, Shaanxi native Yang Xi killed her husband. Life with him had been “worse than hell”, but the last straw was when he came up to her with a rope and axe. He threatened to slaughter her family, including her child, if she did not kill herself. “All those years, he’d often threaten (me) and then make good on those threats,” the 41-year-old recounted. “In that instance, all the grievances accumulated over six years — including him beating my mother and child — finally erupted.” That night, she picked up the axe and killed him. “I didn’t expect myself to have the guts to do such a thing,” she said. “Afterwards I was frightened, yet relieved to know that no one would beat me, my mother, my father and my child any more.”  It was not her first abusive relationship. When she was 17, her fiancé became violent after she asked to delay their wedding. According to her mother, he was of “inferior” character and afraid Yang would change her mind. Over two years, their relationship soured. One day, he pushed her down when they were arguing and gouged her eyes out with his hands. He was sentenced to death, according to her. Feeling like she could not survive as a blind, unmarried woman in a poor rural area, she got married twice — the second time to the man who beat and threatened her. She was sentenced to 12 years in jail for killing him and released after eight years. In jail, where she learnt how to be a masseuse, Yang said she met female inmates who had been similarly abused.  About one in four women in China are said to have experienced domestic violence. Every 7.4 seconds, another woman falls victim to this deeply entrenched problem, according to the All-China Women's Federation, the country’s largest women’s organisation. Can the world’s most populous nation stem the scourge, asks the programme Undercover Asia. ‘PATRIARCHAL POWER’ China remains a traditional society that prizes harmony in the household, arising from Confucian patriarchy. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. And in some regions, wife-beating is a symbol of “patriarchal power”, said Ma Sainan, the chief lawyer handling marriage and family cases at Jiali Law Firm. “(Some men) don’t think of it as something immoral and may even take pride in it.”  Many women endure more than 30 episodes of violence before they seek help or go to the police, noted Lin Shuang, an anti-domestic violence volunteer in Shanghai for eight years. Even after divorcing or leaving their abuser, some victims are unable to break free. In September, a 30-year-old vlogger from Sichuan province was doused with petrol and set alight by her ex-husband while she was live-streaming at home. Lamu’s death, after she suffered 90 per cent burns, stoked a public outcry. Although a higher proportion of victims are in rural areas, domestic violence is very much present in cities. Abusers may, however, be more “secretive” in order to keep up a “glamorous” front to neighbours and colleagues, said Ma.  Shanghai resident Wei La (not her real name), a successful entrepreneur, told Undercover Asia how a “sensitive soul” she met in 2019 quickly became a manipulative man. One night when she was a few minutes late arriving at his place, his suspicions about her whereabouts turned violent. He rained punches on her head, kicked her stomach and sat on her. “I felt like I was going to die,” she said. When she seized a window of opportunity to run out of the house, he chased her and yanked her out of a taxi. She managed to get to a friend’s place only after a couple passing by stopped to help. He harassed her and threatened to harm her family and make a scene at her company. “My friend asked me why I didn’t leave him, and I had nothing to say,” she said. “It’s not that I didn’t want to leave him, but he’s like a piece of chewing gum. Even after you tear it off, there are remnants.”  GAPS IN THE LAW The authorities have taken steps in recent years to address domestic violence, but activists say gaps persist. They also highlight the role men play in ensuring that harmful norms and notions do not get passed to future generations. About 157,000 Chinese women commit suicide per year, and in a 2016 study by the All-China Women’s Federation, 60 per cent of the cases were related family violence. That year, the government introduced a domestic violence law that allows victims to obtain protection orders against their abusers. State media reported that complaints about domestic violence made to the women’s federation decreased by 8.4 per cent in 2019 compared to 2018. But observers say this is not the full picture.  “When grievous harm is inflicted, the judge still takes into account family conflict as a mitigating factor for a lighter sentence,” cited Ma, who feels that the law does not go far enough. “It’s hard to understand. If you hit someone in the street, you may face jail time of three to seven years. However, for violence in a family setting, one might get only three years, with it hardly ever going to seven years.” Some police officers are insufficiently trained to deal with domestic violence; for instance, they may tell victims their injuries are “too minor”, said Lin. According to her, victims must do “a lot of work” after going to the police, such as collecting evidence and documenting their injuries. WATCH: China's struggle with domestic violence — A potent patriarchy (46:12)  More victims are now willing to dial the police hotline, and the law requires that all calls be accepted, noted Feng Yuan, co-founder of Equality, a women’s rights and gender equality non-governmental organisation in Beijing. “But what’s the problem now? (It’s that) calls aren’t taken properly. When the police hear that it’s a family matter, they’d just give you some casual advice,” she said. “Or even when they hear that it’s domestic violence, they just dismiss it as a family matter and don’t deal with it properly.” AN EX-ABUSER’S STORY As part of efforts to reduce domestic violence against women, the China White Ribbon Volunteers Network — launched in 2013 by sexologist Fang Gang — counsels abusers.  One of its volunteers, Gu Wei, used to beat his wife so badly — with fist clenched “like an iron hammer” — over four years that she filed for divorce. While searching online for information on claiming child custody, he chanced upon a television documentary about domestic violence that, incidentally, featured Yang. He felt “miserable” after watching the women recount their experiences. He called a hotline number provided and spoke to a psychologist trained to work with abusers. He realised he had learnt violence from his father and other male relatives. His parents also saw him mistreating his wife but sided with him. Today, he is “worried” his son will pick up violent behaviour from him.  Now divorced, he has explained to his son that he had hurt the boy’s mother, so she had to leave “to protect herself”. He tells the nine-year-old that they should respect her, and lets him visit her. In 2018, the ex-abuser performed in a play called The Penis Monologues, inspired by American playwright Eve Ensler’s The Vagina Monologues. Written by Fang, it explores masculinity issues including domestic violence. In it, Gu shared that he had asked his ex-wife for five years to prove that he has given up his abusive ways. “I want these violent practices to stop in my generation,” he said.

Singapore,"Hotel concierge on medical leave for symptoms related to COVID-19 left home to see friend, gets jail",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/hotel-concierge-mc-covid-19-symptoms-stay-home-jail-14748414,1620205688,"SINGAPORE: A hotel concierge at Fullerton Hotel was given medical leave for five days after reporting a cough and runny nose, but failed to stay at home as instructed. Instead of staying at home, Prabu Rajendran went to stay over with a friend and later took a cab home without a mask, falling asleep in the vehicle and getting arrested after tussling with police officers. He was later found to have flouted conditions of his five-day medical certificate while filling up a health declaration at the police station. The 28-year-old man was given two weeks' jail on Wednesday (May 5) for one charge of failing to stay home for five days while on medical leave for acute respiratory symptoms. The court heard that Prabu reported to work at Fullerton Hotel at about 1pm on Apr 2, 2020. As he felt feverish, he told his supervisor of his condition and was told to see a doctor. He left the hotel and went to Raffles Medical Clinic in Raffles Place, where he told a doctor that he had a cough with phlegm and that his nose was runny. He was diagnosed with acute respiratory infection and given sick leave for five days from Apr 2 to Apr 6 last year. The doctor told him to stay at home for the entire duration of his MC, and the hard copy of the certificate stated he needed to do so by law. The doctor advised Prabu that he was allowed to leave home only if he needed medical assistance and asked him to get his family to help if he needed food or to call for food delivery. Prabu went home and took a nap but woke up before 9pm that day. When his friend invited him over for dinner, he agreed and took a cab to her home. He did not wear a face mask despite his symptoms. At her home, he drank alcohol and became intoxicated, and spent the night with her. The next day, when leaving his friend's home, Prabu boarded a cab to return to his home. He did not wear a mask on this trip and fell asleep along the way. When the cab arrived at his home, the taxi driver was unable to get Prabu to alight or pay the fare, so he called the police for help. Police officers who arrived at the scene tried to wake Prabu up and subsequently managed to get him to alight. When they asked him whether or not he intended to pay the cab fare, Prabu became uncooperative and started raising his voice. He was arrested after he failed to calm down and was escorted to Bedok Police Division headquarters. While filling up a health declaration there, he disclosed that he was on five days' MC. He did not have COVID-19. The prosecutor sought at least four weeks' jail, saying that Prabu had symptoms associated with COVID-19 but failed to take reasonable precautions. He left his home for about 13 hours for a frivolous reason, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Sanjiv Vaswani. He also ""displayed a wanton disregard for the safety and well-being of the general public"" and did not tell his friend he was on medical leave, he said. The defence tried to ask for the maximum fine of S$10,000. For failing to comply with the conditions to stay at home as stated in his medical certificate, Prabu could have been jailed up to six months, fined up to S$10,000, or both.

Singapore,COVID-19: Banana Leaf Apolo restaurant fined for hosting 40-person birthday party,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/banana-leaf-apolo-restaurant-fined-hosting-party-for-40-covid-19-14748284,1620201973,"SINGAPORE: The Banana Leaf Apolo restaurant was fined S$10,000 by a court on Wednesday (May 5) for hosting a birthday party at its Little India outlet for 40 guests, with a self-service buffet. The general manager of the restaurant chain, which has been operating in Singapore since 1974, pleaded guilty to two charges of breaching COVID-19 regulations. These are for allowing 40 people to gather at the 48 Serangoon Road restaurant between 6pm and 10pm on Sep 12 last year, and for allowing some of them to make speeches. Another three charges were considered in sentencing. The court heard that the restaurant accepted an advance booking for the group for a birthday celebration on the second floor. Employees set up a sound system, microphones and a projector for customers to make speeches and to show a video montage. Food was also laid out for consumption. Safe distancing ambassadors reported that there was a large group of people celebrating on the second floor. According to the ambassadors, as well as what was captured on closed-circuit television, the customers talked and mingled across tables without a 1m safe distance, and the tables and chairs were placed close together. Customers helped themselves to food at the buffet and served it to others, and none of the employees told them not to do this. The restaurant manager was not there when safe distancing ambassadors went down, as he was on the ground floor. The prosecution sought a fine of S$10,000, or S$5,000 per proceeded charge. Deputy Public Prosecutor Stephanie Koh categorised this as ""a serious breach"", as the event lasted four hours and involved a large group of people who intermingled in close proximity. ""This was an event that did pose a high risk of transmission of virus and could have been a cluster if anyone was infected,"" said Ms Koh, adding that it did not happen in this case. She said there was ""no reason"" for the restaurant to accept such a large booking given the COVID-19 restrictions. They did not have measures to manage the movement of customers, and instead, facilitated some breaches by providing equipment, she added. The restaurant manager said in court: ""We would like to apologise for what happened and we have taken a lot of measures to ensure that this doesn't happen ever again, sir."" The company could have been fined up to S$10,000 per charge of breaching a COVID-19 regulation."

He was given a discharge amounting to an acquittal for a second charge of perverting the course of justice in filing a defence case and had been administered a stern warning for this. Wong, 62, was a practising advocate and solicitor and the director of law firm S Y Wong Law Chambers at the time of the offence in 2017. The court heard that a deputy superintendent of the Singapore Police Force led a group of police officers in an operation at the back lane between Lorong 14 and Lorong 16 Geylang on the night of Jan 13, 2017. Police detained about 10 people suspected of being secret society members and were conducting checks on them when Wong arrived at the location and loitered nearby. The deputy superintendent approached Wong and asked if he was a police officer at about 10.10pm. Wong shouted at him in an angry tone, saying he was ""bigger"" than a police officer. When the officer asked him what he meant, Wong shouted that he ""is an officer from the Supreme Court"" and therefore the police officer had to call him ""sir"". His shouting drew the attention of some suspects as well as the public. When the police verified Wong's identity and asked him to leave as his behaviour was hindering their operation, Wong refused to and was arrested. The court heard that Wong has previous convictions, including disobeying an order from a public servant in 1994 and using threatening, abusive or insulting words of behaviour in 2001. The prosecutor said Wong's referring to his status as a lawyer ""sullies the good name of the legal profession"" and the fine must be sufficiently high to reflect this. Wong's lawyer said his client apologises for the wrong he has done but said the police officer was shouting at him, prompting an ""impulsive reaction"" to shout back. In 2018, Wong made headlines after the highest disciplinary body for lawyers suspended him for the maximum five years for professional misconduct. He had stared at the breasts of a victim of molestation during cross-examination and repeatedly asked if she thought she was attractive. After that, he commanded her to stand up and scrutinised her chest. His client was then accused of brushing his forearm against her breast on the train. Wong later said he was trying to mount a case claiming that the victim was unattractive and his client would not have been motivated to outrage her modesty. Any contact that took place was accidental. His client was found guilty and jailed for five months."
Singapore,Woman jailed for injecting insulin into her son for 'peaceful' death in plan to kill entire family over her childhood rape,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/woman-jailed-injecting-insulin-into-son-childhood-rape-14747728,1620192251,"SINGAPORE: A woman who was raped and molested by her older brother when she was a young girl developed traumatic symptoms that were triggered when she saw her brother lead a ""normal life"" by getting married and having a child. The woman, now 29, decided to set her entire family on fire and kill herself, but wanted to spare her favourite son, who was then six to seven years old, by giving him a ""peaceful"" death with less pain. She injected him with insulin on 13 occasions over seven months, giving the boy headaches, dangerously low blood sugar levels and a seizure. The woman, who cannot be named to protect the identity of her son, was given five years' jail on Wednesday (May 5) for one charge of poisoning her son. After medical staff detected something amiss with the boy's repeated hospitalisation, the woman's offences were uncovered. She was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and Munchausen syndrome, a disorder where a person makes up a disease. The court heard that the woman stayed with her parents and her three brothers when she was born. When she was nine to 12, one of her brothers molested and raped her. He was sentenced to a boys' home, but the woman ""hated him"" because of what he had done to her. Her relationship with her mother deteriorated as she felt her mother had taken her brother's side. The woman also asserted that her father had also raped and molested her, but this was not proven in investigations. She ran away and got married. She lived with her husband and had two daughters and a son with him. Sometime in 2017, after her father died, the mother of the accused moved to live with her. In September 2018, the brother who had raped her got married. A few months later, his wife became pregnant and the accused found out about this. The court heard that this made the accused angry with her brother for being able to move on with his life. She felt he did not deserve such happiness after what he had done to her. HER PLAN TO KILL HER FAMILY The accused decided to kill herself, her mother, her brother and her three children in September 2019, when her brother's wife gave birth. She intended to burn everyone alive with petrol, except for her only son, her favourite child. She intended to kill him by injecting insulin into him, as she did not want him to die in pain. At the same time, the boy reminded her of her brother and she began hating him. After searching online for a ""peaceful"" way to die, the woman chanced upon the use of insulin. She found that high doses could cause one's blood sugar to crash, leading to brain damage, coma, or death. She decided to use two to three insulin pens at one go and inject a high dose into the victim. She bought the pens from Malaysia and learned how to use them by watching YouTube. She administered the first dose to the boy, who was then six, in January 2019 after taking him to Causeway Point for lunch. She injected the insulin in his arm in the toilet after the meal and observed him, noticing that he became ""extra hungry"". She continued to do this between January and July 2019, administering 20 to 30 units of insulin to the boy on 13 occasions. He began feeling side effects such as severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, double vision, tinnitus, photosensitivity and numbness in fingers. He was hospitalised three times with low blood sugar levels and a hypoglycemic seizure on one occasion. Medical staff puzzled over the cause of his symptoms, and he had to be rescued with intravenous drips. In July 2019, the victim went to the zoo for a school trip. According to a teacher, he was fine, but his mother claimed he was having a seizure and administered insulin to him. The hospital later confirmed he did not have a seizure on this occasion. HOSPITAL UNCOVERS PLAN During a hospital visit on Jul 16, 2019, a therapist spoke to the victim, who said his mother had injected him with medication from a pen on many occasions on his arms and buttocks. He said he would be hungry after the medication and opened his haversack to show biscuits and sweets that were inside. Hospital staff confronted the accused that day, and after she admitted to injecting insulin into her son, the hospital called the police. The victim showed symptoms suggestive of PTSD and has been discharged into the care of child protection services. PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION His mother was arrested and subsequently remanded. She was found to have major depressive disorder of moderate severity and PTSD, as she was directly exposed on multiple occasions to sexual violence by her biological father and brother, psychiatric reports said. She was found to be a pathological liar, with her behaviour towards her son showing her need for attention. One report found her case to be a “classic presentation of ... Munchausen syndrome by proxy”, where she created symptoms of illness in her son for attention. She also displayed strong antisocial personality traits, although they did not amount to a disorder. While her disorders substantially contributed to the offences, she was not of unsound mind at the time and she knew what she was doing, and that her actions would harm or even kill her son, the reports concluded. PROSECUTION CALLS FOR SIX YEARS' JAIL, DEFENCE ASKS FOR FOUR Deputy Public Prosecutor Bhajanvir Singh asked for six years' jail for the woman, saying she needs three to four years' treatment for rehabilitation. She cannot be relied on to be an effective and safe mother towards her children, he said. While she has shown some improvement due to the counselling, trauma-focused therapy and medication she has been receiving in remand, she remains ""an unreliable and ineffective mother"", said Mr Singh. She has also continued to lie to her cellmates, friends and prison counsellor that her son was fathered as a result of her brother's rape as she felt she would ""enjoy more sympathy"" this way, he said. While in remand, she has lost her temper at other inmates and thrown tantrums that drew disciplinary actions against her. ""This is typically a case where the accused was unable to accept the fact that her brother was able to move on with his life,"" said Mr Singh. ""Because of this inability to accept this, she harboured dangerous thoughts of killing her brother, her mother, herself and her three children. In fact, she said she intended to do this in September (2019). This coincides with the time her brother's wife gave birth."" He said the insulin injections would have continued if not for the alertness of the staff at National University Hospital, and that the accused ""played with the life of her son"". He added that the charge she faces is amalgamated and she could be jailed for up to 20 years, double the punishment as it is amalgamated and includes multiple instances of offending. Defence lawyer Ng Pei Qi said six years is not warranted, calling instead for four years' jail. She said her client was molested and raped by her father and brother since she was nine. ""Her trauma is so deep-rooted that she sees the face of her attacker in her son,"" she said, calling the case ""a tragic backlash of years of untreated trauma"". The accused is ""a slave"" to her mental disorders and felt guilty, feeding her son snacks after the injections as she felt she was countering the acts of insulin. ""The court is not sentencing a cold-blooded woman today, who cannot move on from her past, but a victim whose trauma has caught up with her,"" she said. In response, the prosecution said depression, even if severe, cannot be a licence to kill others, and that the accused knew what she was doing. ""The rape by the father is an assertion made, and not something that is borne out by investigations, while investigations revealed that she was molested and raped by her brother, there is nothing to show that she was actually raped and molested by her father,"" said Mr Singh. The judge noted that the accused's conduct was ""clearly reprehensible"", but also that she had mental disorders that substantially impaired her mental responsibility for the acts."
Singapore,"Pregnant woman jailed for abusing maid, making her eat hair and cotton wool",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/pregnant-woman-jailed-abusing-maid-hit-slap-eat-hair-14747500,1620187239,"SINGAPORE: A heavily pregnant woman was jailed for eight weeks on Wednesday (May 5) for abusing her domestic helper by hitting and slapping her, as well as forcing her to eat dirty cotton wool and hair off the toilet floor. Tan Hui Mei, 35, was also ordered to pay the victim S$3,200 in compensation or serve another 16 days' jail in default. Tan pleaded guilty to two charges of voluntarily causing hurt to a domestic helper, with three other charges considered in sentencing. The court heard that Tan, an administrator, lived with her husband, her mother and her three daughters at the time of the offences. The victim, a 24-year-old Indonesian woman, began working for Tan in November 2018 for S$600 a month. She was tasked with household chores, cooking and caring for Tan's youngest daughter, a toddler at the time. Sometime between November 2018 and March 2019, Tan made the victim eat a piece of dirty cotton wool on the dining table and watched as she placed it in her mouth. In the same period, she also instructed the maid to eat hair that was on the toilet floor and also watched her do so. In December 2018, the victim called the police to say that Tan had slapped her a few times as she was unhappy with her work performance, but the victim decided to return to Tan's home to continue working for her. On the morning of Mar 30, 2019, the victim bathed and fed Tan's toddler before leaving the child in a room with Tan's mother and second daughter. When the toddler began crying, the victim did not attend to her as she thought Tan's mother or other daughter would do so. Tan, who was sleeping in her own room, confronted the victim and asked why she did not take care of the toddler. When the victim tried to explain, Tan slapped both sides of her face and hit her forehead three times, causing it to swell. The victim did not retaliate and continued doing her household chores. The next night, Tan called the victim to her bedroom and said she could not sleep as her legs were aching. She asked the victim to massage her legs, but the victim fell asleep while doing so. Tan pinched her forearm and told her not to close her eyes. The victim felt pain and continued the massage. The victim later told her sister what happened, and her sister called the Centre for Domestic Employees for help. Police went to Tan's home, and the victim was taken to hospital with bruises on her forehead and arm. When Tan was first investigated, she denied committing the offences. The victim was unemployed for seven months from April 2019 until she found work with a new household in December 2019, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Kathy Chu. Ms Chu asked for at least 12 to 15 weeks' jail and a compensation order of at least S$3,200 for the victim's pain and lost earnings. OFFENCES OUT OF CHARACTER: DEFENCE Defence lawyer Genesa Tan asked at first for a probation report or a fine. When the judge rejected this, she asked for not more than six weeks' jail and a smaller compensation order. She said her client is a first-time offender and the offences are ""completely out of character for her"". Tan has been employing domestic helpers for more than 10 years with no issue, and one former maid wrote a testimonial about her good treatment. She said the instance where the victim made a previous police report resulted in no action as the police found that it was ""unfounded"". After this, Tan had made more conscientious effort to make the victim feel at home, said the lawyer. The incidents occurred in the short span of about a month, said the lawyer, adding that her client is unable to explain her actions except to say it was impulsive and she is remorseful. Tan, who is in her last trimester of pregnancy, asked to speak to the judge directly. She said she knew she was in the wrong and asked for leniency, saying she has three children and a fourth on the way, with a sickly mother who needs reminding to take her medication. ""I just want you to know, I know I am wrong, and my family needs me, and I also don't wish to give birth in prison and be separate from my children,"" she said. The judge said sentencing norms for abuse of domestic helpers are usually jail terms unless there are exceptional circumstances, which are not present in this case. He noted the two acts of physical hurt, as well as the psychological harm for the charges taken into consideration of eating cotton wool and hair."
World,2 Asian American women stabbed in San Francisco attack,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/2-asian-american-women-stabbed-in-san-francisco-attack-14747094,1620183503,"SAN FRANCISCO: Police were hunting for a man who stabbed two Asian American women without warning on Tuesday (May 4) afternoon in San Francisco's Mid-Market area. Officers were sent to 4th and Stockton streets shortly before 5pm (6.30am on Wednesday, Singapore time) and found the wounded women, who were taken to a hospital. There was no immediate word on their conditions. Witnesses told KPIX-TV that one woman appeared to be elderly and the other appeared to be in her 30s. They told the station that a man clutching a knife was walking down Market Street when he approached a bus stop, stabbed the women, and then walked away. Police didn't immediately indicate whether the women were specifically targeted or whether the attack might be a hate crime. Asian Americans have been the target of several unprovoked attacks in the San Francisco Bay Area in recent months. Prosecutors have filed assault and hate crime charges against a man accused of an attack last week in which he allegedly yelled racial slurs before knocking down Carl Chan, president of the Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce. In separate San Francisco attacks in March, an 83-year-old Vietnamese man was knocked down and broke his neck in the fall, and a 77-year-old woman was similarly attacked. Police arrested a man for assault and elder abuse in both cases. Another 83-year-old man was pushed down in February, broke a hip and spent weeks in the hospital and in rehabilitation."
World,German far-right crime rises; police arrest alleged neo-Nazi,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/german-far-right-crime-rises--police-arrest-alleged-neo-nazi-14744594,1620158250,"BERLIN: Berlin police arrested a 53-year-old German man on suspicion of sending dozens of threatening letters to politicians, lawyers and journalists that were signed with the acronym of a neo-Nazi group, as officials warned on Tuesday (May 4)of a disturbing rise in far-right extremism across Germany. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said far-right crimes rose 5.65 per cent in 2020, accounting for more than half of all “politically motivated” crimes. “This shows again that right-wing extremism is the biggest threat for our country,” Seehofer told reporters Tuesday. In carrying out Monday's arrest in Berlin, police seized an unencrypted hard drive with data that might help with an ongoing probe, said Holger Muench, the head of Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office. “There was a lot of data, but it needs to be evaluated,” he said. The suspect, whose name wasn’t released for privacy reasons, has previous convictions for “numerous crimes, including ones motivated by right-wing ideology,” said prosecutors in Frankfurt who are handling the case. The letters were signed “NSU 2.0.” A German group called the National Socialist Underground was responsible for a string of violent crimes between 1998 and 2011, including the racially motivated killings of nine men with immigrant backgrounds and a police officer. The group's name was derived from the full name of the Nazi, or National Socialist, party. Police think the suspect sent almost 100 letters to dozens of people and organisations across Germany and Austria since 2018. German news agency dpa reported that investigators think the suspect may have obtained personal data on the people he targeted. The case raised suspicions that suspect was connected with the police after it emerged that the personal data of three people who received threats had been accessed on police computers, dpa reported. State Interior Minister Peter Beuth said, however, the man arrested had no connection to police. Frankfurt attorney Seda Basay-Yildiz, who received one of the threats, was not convinced, however, saying the perpetrator had access to a new and confidential address for her. “For me, there are still too many unanswered questions,” she told Der Spiegel magazine. German security agencies have warned of the growing threat of violent far-right extremism. In July 2019, a regional politician from Chancellor Angela Merkel's party was killed by a neo-Nazi; three months later, a gunman tried to force his way into a synagogue on Yom Kippur, killing two people. Seehofer said antisemitic crimes in Germany were up 15.7 per cent in 2020 over 2019 with 2,351 total incidents - 94.6 per cent of which were committed by a far-right suspect. Of the total, 62 were acts of violence while the majority were antisemitic hate speech and other related crimes, frequently on the internet or over social media, Seehofer said. “This development in Germany is not only troubling, but in view of our history, deeply shameful,” he said. Moshe Kantor, president of the European Jewish Congress, said the German numbers highlighted a broader issue. “This is a wake-up call, not just for Germany, but for the whole world,"" he said. ""These figures should ring alarm bells, because we are seeing similar trends across the Western world.” In 2020, Germany recorded a 72.4 per cent increase in anti-immigrant crimes, up to 5,298 total cases, Seehofer said. In the most deadly incident, nine people with immigrant backgrounds were shot dead in Hanau, near Frankfurt, in February by a gunman who had called for genocide. Authorities have raised concerns about the role the far-right Alternative for Germany party allegedly played in stoking a climate of resentment toward immigrants and the government. The party, which placed third in Germany's 2017 election, has moved steadily to the right in recent years, drawing increasing scrutiny from the country's domestic intelligence agency. On Tuesday, Alternative for Germany's section in Berlin condemned a member who appeared to lament the absence of attacks on Merkel. The website Business Insider reported that AfD's former chairman in Berlin, Guenter Brinker, forwarded a message stating that “either that piece of dirt is so well protected that nobody can get at her, or don't the Germans have any balls?” Brinker said later he had mistakenly forwarded the message and regretted doing so and that he rejected “all forms of hatred and violence.” Many in the AfD have expressed support for, and participated in, the regular protests in Germany against lockdown measures, organised by the Querdenker movement. The demonstrations have become increasingly violent, and the country's domestic intelligence service last month said it had put some members of the movement under observation. The protests have brought together a broad range of demonstrators, including people opposing vaccinations, those who deny the existence of the coronavirus, mask opponents, conspiracy theorists and others. Seehofer said the protests have also attracted neo-Nazis and other right-wing extremists, and have regularly become violent, targeting police and the media. Seehofer said of the 260 reported crimes against journalists, 112 were related to protests against coronavirus restrictions. “I want to say here very clearly: These acts of violence are no longer about exercising a constitutional right (to demonstrate), but are acts of violence of a criminal nature that I condemn in the strongest possible terms,” he said."
Singapore,"Man acquitted of sexually abusing stepson but jailed for stalking his girlfriend, criminal intimidation",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-acquitted-of-sexually-abusing-stepson-jailed-stalking-14742810,1620133862,"SINGAPORE: A man accused of sexually grooming his stepson over nine years to the extent that the underage boy asked for sexual acts was acquitted of all sex offences against him on Tuesday (May 4). The 55-year-old man, who cannot be named because of a gag order protecting his stepson's identity, was convicted of two other charges of stalking his stepson's girlfriend and criminal intimidation against his wife and stepson. He was given a year's jail for these two charges. Since he has been in remand for about two years and five months, he will likely be released on Tuesday or Wednesday. The man went on trial for 15 charges including sexual assault by penetration, sexual assault of a minor, outrage of modesty and procuring an indecent act by a child. However, Justice Chua Lee Ming acquitted him of the 13 assorted charges relating to the sexual abuse of his stepson, who is now 22. He convicted the man only of stalking his stepson's girlfriend in 2015 and 2016 by sending harassing messages and loitering near her home, and of criminally intimidating his own wife by pointing a chopper at her and saying he was going to kill her son three days after he told his family about the allegations. THE PROSECUTION'S CASE According to the prosecution's case, the man sexually groomed his stepson between 2007 and 2012, when the boy was between eight and 14. They said the boy grew accustomed to the sex acts because of their ""sheer frequency"" and ""even on some occasions, initiated the sexual acts by asking for ... that thing"". He was unaware the acts were wrong and was told by the older man to keep their activities a secret, said prosecutors. When the stepson got a girlfriend in 2015 and introduced her to the offender and his wife, the offender allegedly tried to initiate sex acts again, the prosecution claimed in their case. According to the prosecution, when the stepson resisted him, the older man began to harass the girlfriend until the stepson gave in. On Jan 15, 2016, when the older man tried to enter the shower with him, the stepson broke down and told his mother about what happened. Most of his family pressured him against pursuing the matter, but the stepson filed a police report and gave statements to the police, the court heard during the trial. The stepson's mother testified about her ""anger"" when she first found out about the allegations but said she continued to visit her husband in prison. She also repeatedly asked her son to withdraw the case ""because I felt this was a family problem"" and her husband was ""already old"". The defence had argued that the stepson's versions of events provided in court were different from all the statements he provided to the police, and that none of the prosecution witnesses was able to corroborate the events. Their versions were also inconsistent with the stepson's, they argued. Instead, the accused was consistent throughout in his denial of the sexual assault. THE JUDGE'S FINDINGS In acquitting the man of the sexual offences, Justice Chua said cases involving such offences require the complainant's evidence to be unusually convincing that the prosecution's case is proven beyond reasonable doubt solely on that basis. He agreed with the defence - Mr Pramnath Vijayakumar and Ms Sadhana Rai from Law Society Pro Bono Services - that the stepson's evidence is not so unusually convincing as to amount to proof beyond reasonable doubt, because of the ""many inconsistencies in his evidence"". ""I have come to this conclusion after having considered the evidence in detail, and giving due consideration to, among other things, the lapse of time and the complainant's age at the time of the alleged offences,"" he said. Justice Chua said the inconsistencies relate to the manner that the sexual assault was carried out, and are ""extensive"". He gave specific examples of how the stepson's evidence in court was repeatedly at odds with what he had earlier said in police statements. In one incident, the stepson testified in court that he recalled a particular sex act in the living room of their one-room flat in 2012 because it was the last time that it happened between him and the accused. However, in a statement he gave to the police in 2016, he had said that the older man performed the sex act in 2015. The judge gave several other examples of inconsistencies that are too graphic to detail. ""One may argue about the materiality of some of the inconsistencies, viewed in isolation,"" he said. ""However, the inconsistencies have to be viewed in context."" NUMEROUS AND EXTENSIVE INCONSISTENCIES He said the inconsistencies were both numerous and extensive, and that the prosecution's case was that the stepson was able to pinpoint timeframes of the incidents by relying on his ""episodic memory"" - such as the first incident of sexual intrusion in 2007 and the first incident of penetration before his PSLE in 2010. ""The impactful nature of these incidents makes the numerous and extensive inconsistencies even more significant,"" said Justice Chua. ""The complainant has not given credible explanations for the inconsistencies. Viewed in totality and in context, the inconsistencies give rise to grave doubts about the credibility of the complainant’s evidence as to the alleged offences. I agree with the defence that the complainant’s credit has been impeached."" He pointed to other types of evidence that contribute to doubts about the credibility of the stepson's evidence: He had testified that the sexual acts began in 2007 and continued without any breaks, including incidents from January to March 2010. However, the accused was in prison from May 2009 to March 2010. When reminded of this fact and given a chance to explain, he maintained that he remembered sexual activity in the first three months of 2010 and later said that ""maybe there were"" sexual activities. The offender moved into the one-room flat after marrying his stepson's mother in June 2007. The room was shared by the stepson's sister and her husband, and there were five adults and a baby living in the one-room flat for most of the time. ""I accept that not everyone would have been at home at the same time. Nevertheless, I have doubts about the complainant's allegations that the accused frequently engaged in sexual activities with the complainant at the flat,"" said the judge. The stepson had also claimed that he realised the acts were wrong only when he was in Secondary 3 when he began attending science and religious classes. He claimed his religious teacher told him it is sinful for two people of the same gender to have sex. However, his cousin, who also attended the classes, testified that the complainant went only once or twice a month from 2007 and 2010 because he asked him to. The complainant was not a student, he went just to ""hang out"" and he did not go in 2013 when he was in Secondary 3, his cousin said. The judge also noted that while the stepson was diagnosed by the Institute of Mental Health to have panic disorder without agoraphobia, the alleged sexual incidents do not appear to be the stressors. Instead, the stressors are: That the accused did not believe his stepson was not well, that the accused was in jail and the stress of National Service. The man could have been jailed for between eight and 20 years if convicted of sexually assaulting a minor. The penalties for sexual penetration of a minor are a maximum jail term of 10 years, a fine, or both, while molesting a minor draws up to five years' jail, a fine, caning, or any combination of these punishments. If he had been convicted of committing or procuring the commission of any indecent act with a child, he could have been jailed for up to five years, fined up to S$10,000, or both for the first offence."
